$10,000 gold?
SAN FRANCISCO - It has never been easy to have a rational discussion about the value of gold.
Recently, with the price of gold having risen by more than 300% in the last decade, it is more difficult than ever.
Just last December, fellow economists Martin Feldstein and Nouriel Roubini each wrote a book boldly questioning bullish market sentiment and sensibly pointing out the risks of gold.
Did you not know?
Since the publication of their articles, the price of gold has risen even further.
The price of gold recently reached a record high of $1,300.
Last December, many gold miners argued that the price was inevitably heading toward $2,000.
Now, encouraged by continued appreciation, some suggest that gold could rise even higher.
A successful gold investor recently told me that stock prices stagnated for more than a decade before the Dow Jones index surpassed 1,000 points in the early 1980 "s.
Since then, the index has risen above 10,000.
Now that gold has passed the magical $1,000 mark, why can it not increase tenfold?
Admittedly, achieving a much higher gold price is not quite as imaginative.
In inflation-adjusted terms, the price today is nowhere near the all-time high of January 1980.
Back then, gold cost $850; now it's well over $2,000.
But January 1980 was arguably the culmination of a period of heightened geopolitical instability.
At $1,300, the price of gold today is probably more than twice the very long-term, inflation-adjusted average price of gold.
So what could justify another huge rise in the price of gold from here?
One answer, of course, is a total collapse of the US dollar.
With soaring deficits and a rudderless fiscal policy, one wonders whether a populist government might not turn to the printing press lightly.
And if you're really worried about it, gold may actually be the most reliable hedge.
Of course, one could argue that inflation-indexed bonds provide a better and more direct inflation hedge than gold.
But goldbeetles are right to worry about whether the government will meet its obligations in more extreme circumstances.
Indeed, as Carmen Reinhart and I discuss in our recent book on the history of financial crises, This Time is Different, cash-strapped governments will often forcibly convert indexed debt into unindexed debt, precisely so that its value could be inflated.
Even the United States abolished indexation clauses in bond contracts during the Great Depression of the 1930 "s.
Nonetheless, the fact that very high inflation is possible does not make it likely, so one should be careful when arguing that higher gold prices are driven by inflation expectations.
Some argue instead that gold's long upward trend is partly due to the development of new financial instruments that facilitate gold trading and speculation.
There is probably some truth and some irony to this argument.
After all, medieval alchemists engaged in an absurd search for ways to turn base metals into gold.
Wouldn't it be paradoxical, then, if financial alchemy could dramatically increase the value of a bar of gold?
In my view, the strongest argument for today's high gold price is the dramatic rise of Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East into the global economy.
As legions of new consumers gain purchasing power, demand inevitably increases, pushing up the price of scarce raw materials.
At the same time, emerging-market central banks need to accumulate gold reserves, which they still hold to a much smaller extent than rich-country central banks. As the euro looks less appetizing as a diversification game away from the dollar, gold's appeal has naturally increased.
So, yes, there are solid fundamentals that support today's higher gold price, though it is much more questionable whether, and to what extent, they will continue to support higher prices in the future.
In fact, another crucial fundamental factor that has sustained high gold prices may turn out to be much more short-lived than globalization.
Gold prices are extremely sensitive to global interest rate movements.
After all, gold pays no interest and even costs something to store.
With interest rates near or at record lows in many countries, it is now relatively cheap to speculate on gold instead of investing in bonds.
But if real interest rates rise significantly, as they may one day, the price of gold could plummet.
Most economic research suggests that gold prices are very difficult to predict in the short to medium term, with roughly equal odds of gains and losses.
It is therefore dangerous to assume short-term trends.
Yes, gold had a great run, but so did global house prices until a few years ago.
If you are a high-net-worth investor, a sovereign wealth fund, or a central bank, it makes sense to hold a modest portion of your portfolio in gold to hedge against extreme events.
But, despite the increased appeal of gold in the wake of an extraordinary price rise, it remains a very risky bet for most of us.
Of course, such considerations may have little impact on prices.
What was true for the alchemists of old is still true today: gold and reason are often difficult to reconcile.
Is Iraq the Next Afghanistan?
At the start of the US-led war in Iraq, two competing views shaped the outcome predictions.
The first claimed that the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime would usher in a democratic era in Iraq that would serve as a model and catalyst for democratic change in the region.
Mocked by critics as a new "domino theory," this view portrayed intervention in Iraq as akin to America's role in post-World War II Japan.
Against the optimism of this "Japan scenario," pessimists argued that a "Somalia scenario" was more likely.
They laid claim to Iraq's tribal, sectarian, and multi-ethnic character, which, in the absence of a dictatorship, would supposedly lead to Iraq's collapse into a "failed state" with rampant warlords, ethnic and religious feuds, and the sanctuary of terrorist organizations.
But the main question now is whether Iraq will drift somewhere between these two scenarios, which increasingly resembles Afghanistan.
This "Afghan scenario" implies a weak state with nominal power over effectively autonomous fiefdoms led by strongmen in the central government.
As bad as it sounds, this prospect seems to be a "realistic" compromise between the supposedly utopian vision of a thriving, united democracy and the misery of a failed state.
Many of the actions and policies of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), as well as higher-level decisions by the Bush administration, seem to indicate a resigned recognition that early hopes that Iraq would introduce Western-style democracy were misplaced.
Indeed, such hopes were misplaced.
Iraq's political culture - and that of most of the Middle East - is incompatible with the basic components of a recognizable Western-style democracy: notions of individual rights and responsibilities are absent, the concept of a patriarchal state is deeply rooted, and individual cultural identity is rarely linked to the national community.
On the other hand, analyses that consider the "traditional" character of Iraqi society as an obstacle to liberal democracy employ a lot of circular logic.
Far from being neutral, these analyses inadvertently lead to a prolonged confrontation.
In Iraq, as elsewhere in the Arab and Muslim world, a culture war is being waged between two paradigms: grand narratives that accept and promote a collectivist understanding (nationalism, socialism, Islamism), and an implicit paradigm of individualist modernity that is locally rooted but shaped by global experience.
The front lines of this war are notions of the individual, cultural identity, civil society and the nation state.
The religious-Islamic component of Iraqi social life should not be underestimated.
But neither should it be equated with political Islamism, which seeks to capitalize on it.
Nationalist and leftist political discourses have left their mark on Iraq's value system, but they are not its only constituents.
Indeed, the nominal acceptance of grand narratives of "democracy" and "human rights" as common foundations of political discourse represents a decisive shift in the delimitation of cultural struggle.
This cultural debate is not limited to the Arab scene.
There is lively discussion in the West, too, about the applicability of democratic institutions in the Arab context.
Advocates of the concept of "Arab exceptionalism," which calls into question Arab societies "ability to adapt to democratic systems, are, in fact, objectively allied with" grand narrative "ideologues - and also with the beneficiaries of the Arab world's patronage-based political order.
The models used in the West for analyzing and interpreting Arab societies, both in political circles and academia, are seriously flawed.
In particular, many analyses today promote an ethnic model that reduces Iraq to an artificial construct based on a fragmented "reality" of divided communities.
Some have even suggested accelerating the outcome predicted by this misconception by dividing Iraq into its "real" original constituents: Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds.
Indeed, Iraqi society is more complex.
The reception and adoption of democracy is not a function of religious affiliation, but a reflection of the multidimensional historical, cultural, religious and political identities of Iraqi individuals.
Under the right circumstances, it is extraordinarily possible to mobilise Iraqi society for the democratic formulation of its future state.
The fall of Saddam heralds the right circumstances.
Indeed, the apparent failure of a discernible democratic core that emerged in Iraq in the first few months after the collapse of Saddam's dictatorship stems more from peculiarities of the process than from any supposedly essential character of Iraqi society.
After the fall of Saddam, there was a large "center" in Iraq that was favorable to democratic discourses and practices.
Political mistakes and reversals have eroded that middle ground, paving the way for ideological Islamism and a resurgent neo-Baath.
The main mistake was that the occupying forces failed to equip and enable the small group of liberal democratic figures in Iraq to strike that middle ground, and as a result, the space for a liberal democratic outcome shrank.
But treating this setback as a failure would be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Iraqi democrats need to reassess and develop a clear public strategy.
The Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the international community must not prejudice the outcome of their efforts by accepting a superficial and false view of Iraqi society.
Even if such efforts succeed, the road to a fully-fledged democratic system in Iraq will still be arduous and expensive.
But, instead of giving in to a "Somalia scenario," dreaming of a "Japan scenario," or being content with an "Afghanistan scenario," Iraq may yet become a "scenario" for successful intervention in the twenty-first century.
< unk > Neo-Ottoman < unk > Turkey?
ANKARA Today, the international media is obsessed with the question of who lost Turkey and what this supposed loss means for Europe and the West.
Even more alarming, some commentators are comparing Turkey's neighbourhood policy to a revival of Ottoman imperialism.
Recently, a senior Turkish columnist went so far as to quote Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu as saying, "We are indeed neo-Ottoman."
As someone who was there when Davutoğlu gave his speech to the parliamentary group of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), I can confirm that he did not use that terminology.
In fact, Davutoğlu and all of us in the AKP's foreign policy community never use this term, simply because it misrepresents our position.
Turkey's neighbourhood policy aims to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood, including the Balkans, the Black Sea, the Caucasus, the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean.
Our aim is to deepen our political dialogue, expand our trade and intensify our personal contacts with our neighbours in the form of sport, tourism and cultural activities.
When Egon Bahr formulated his Ostpolitik in the 1960s, no one asked Will Brandt whether Germany was lost.
God has given Turkey a geographical position that requires us to deal with East and West, North and South.
This is neither a choice nor a luxury, but a necessity.
The symbol of the Byzantine Empire and the Selçuk Empire, which occupied roughly the same geography as Turkey today, was a two-headed eagle looking both east and west.
It should come as no surprise that Turkey also seeks to include both ends of its territory, and feels that its security can best be consolidated by working with its neighbors to minimize risks.
We therefore consider the current debate on Turkey's orientation to be rather superfluous and, in some cases, ill-intentioned.
Our neighbourhood policy needs support, not criticism.
Turkey has become an invaluable asset in the composition of our surrounding regions and is already changing the status quo in favour of greater stability and predictability.
Our efforts to normalise relations with Armenia, for example, are designed to bring about change throughout the South Caucasus.
We are doing our part to share the burden.
Sensible Europeans understand that.
Of course, some of our neighbours are difficult.
But no country has the luxury of choosing its neighbors.
Turkey's neighbourhood policy is very realistic, based on real interests and not some romantic neo-Ottoman nostagia, as some international commentators suggest.
It is true that there is a neo-Ottoman revival in the cultural sphere, and our citizens are eager to rediscover Ottoman life, culture and practices.
As Turkey normalizes domestically, it is also reinterpreting its national historical narrative.
This is a natural by-product of the consolidation of our democracy.
However, the attempt to add imperialist overtones to our carefully constructed foreign policy initiatives is not only a gross misrepresentation, but also grossly contradicts our well-intentioned efforts to stabilise our region.
In Roman mythology, Janus was the god of gates, gates, beginnings and ends.
Today's Turkey is a Janus-headed geography that offers gates and gates to East and West.
It offers beginnings and ends to the Caucasus, the Black Sea, the Balkans and the Mediterranean.
In this capacity, Turkey complements and contributes to a unique transition between otherwise difficult regions, for it represents centuries of coexistence and adaptation.
Turkish foreign policy contributes to this rapprochement and helps its immediate neighbourhoods to connect with each other.
Contrary to recent accusations, Turkish foreign policy makers are not seeking a revival of the Ottoman Empire.
Instead, we are seeking Turkey's historic reintegration into its immediate neighborhood, correcting an anomaly of the Cold War years.
Only the European Union and our other Western NATO allies would benefit from such reintegration.
None of them, therefore, has reason to express unease about Turkey.
1929 or 1989?
PARIS - As the economic crisis deepens and widens, the world is looking for historical analogies to help us understand what is happening.
At the start of the crisis, many compared it to 1982 or 1973, which was reassuring, because both data refer to classic cyclical downturns.
Today, the mood is much darker, and references to 1929 and 1931 are beginning to pile up, even as some governments continue to behave as if the crisis were classic rather than exceptional.
The tendency is either excessive restraint (Europe) or a scattering of efforts (the United States).
Europe is careful to avoid debt and defend the euro, while the US has moved on many fronts to avoid missing an ideal opportunity to implement much-needed structural reforms.
For geo-strategists, however, 1989 is the year that naturally comes to mind, both in politics and in the economy.
Of course, the collapse of Lehman Brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the Berlin Wall.
On the surface, it seems to be its perfect counterpart: the collapse of a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and reassuring institution of financial capitalism.
But 2008-2009, like 1989, may well correspond to an epochal change, the unfolding consequences of which will be felt for decades.
The end of the ideological divide between East and West and the end of absolute trust in the markets are historic turning points.
And what happens in 2009 could jeopardize some of the positive results of 1989, including the peaceful reunification of Europe and the triumph of democratic principles over nationalist, if not xenophobic, tendencies.
In 1989, liberal democracy triumphed over the socialist ideology embodied and promoted by the Eastern Bloc.
For many of his supporters, it was President Ronald Reagan who, with his deliberate escalation of the arms race, pushed the Soviet economy to the brink, fully demonstrating the superiority of liberal societies and free markets.
Of course, there are obvious differences between 1989 and today.
First, and perhaps most importantly, the revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union put an end to global bipolarity.
By contrast, 2009 is likely to pave the way for a new form of bipolarity, albeit with China replacing the Soviet Union.
Second, while democracy and market capitalism appeared as clear, if more fragile, winners in 1989 than expected, it is difficult to distinguish winners from losers in 2009, given the spread of the global crisis.
Everyone seems to be a loser, even if some are more affected than others.
But history is unfair, and the US, despite its greater responsibility for today's global crisis, may emerge from the morass in better shape than most countries.
In better shape, but not alone.
As a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT, I get a good idea of what the world might look like when the crisis is finally over.
One senses something like the emergence of an American-Asian dominated universe.
From the incredible media laboratory at MIT to the mathematical-economics faculties at Harvard, Asians, especially Chinese and Indians, are everywhere, like the Romans in Athens in the first century BC: full of admiration for those from whom they have learned so much and from whom they would overcome in the decades ahead.
But before this new order emerges, the world could face increasing disorder, if not total chaos.
For example, what will happen to a country as central and vulnerable as Egypt if hundreds of thousands of Egyptians working in the Gulf are forced to return home because of the crisis in the oil-producing countries?
When the rich get less rich, the poor get poorer.
And what about the migrant workers who have reached for the "European dream" and are now facing potential outbreaks of xenophobia in the supposedly open countries of Europe?
The consequences of 1989 were ultimately less lasting than many observers, including myself, would have thought.
We can only hope that the consequences of 2009 will ultimately prove to be far less dramatic than we perceive them intuitively and in our historical reflexes.
The end of 1945
NEW YORK - On May 8, 1945, when World War II officially ended in Europe, much of the world lay in ruins.
But if the human capacity for destruction has few limits, the ability to start from scratch is equally remarkable.
Perhaps this is why humanity has been able to survive so far.
There is no doubt that millions of people were too hungry and exhausted at the end of the war to do anything other than stay alive.
But at the same time, a wave of idealism swept over the rubble, a collective sense of determination to build a more just, peaceful, and secure world.
That is why the great war hero Winston Churchill was voted out of office in the summer of 1945, even before Japan surrendered.
Men and women had not risked their lives just to return to the old days of class privilege and social deprivation.
They wanted better housing, education and free healthcare for all.
Similar demands have been heard throughout Europe, where anti-fascist or anti-fascist resistance has often been led by leftists or even communists, and pre-war conservatives have often been burdened by collaboration with fascist regimes.
In countries such as France, Italy and Greece there was talk of revolution.
This did not happen because neither the Western Allies nor the Soviet Union supported it.
Stalin was content to settle for an empire in Eastern Europe.
But even Charles de Gaulle, a right-wing resistance leader, had to accept communists in his first post-war government and agreed to nationalize industry and banks.
The swing to the left, towards social democratic welfare states, took place all over Western Europe.
It was part of the 1945 Consensus.
A different kind of revolution took place in the former colonies of Europe in Asia, where the indigenous peoples no longer wanted to be ruled by the Western powers that had been so shamefully defeated by Japan.
Vietnamese, Indonesians, Filipinos, Burmese, Indians and Malaysians also wanted their freedom.
These aspirations were often expressed in the United Nations, founded in 1945.
Like the dream of European unity, the UN was part of the 1945 consensus.
For a short time, many celebrities, such as Albert Einstein, believed that only a world government would be able to guarantee global peace.
That dream faded quickly as the Cold War divided the world into two hostile blocs, but in some ways Cold War politics strengthened the 1945 consensus in the West.
Communism, still wrapped in the laurel leaf of anti-fascism, exerted a great intellectual and emotional attraction not only in the so-called Third World, but also in Western Europe.
Social democracy, with its promise of greater equality and opportunity for all, served as an ideological antidote.
Most social democrats were in fact bitter anti-communists.
Today, 70 years later, much of the 1945 consensus no longer survives.
Few people can muster much enthusiasm for the UN.
The European dream is in crisis.
And the post-war social democratic welfare state is being increasingly eroded by the day.
The rot began in the 1980s under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.
Neoliberals attacked the cost of social programs and the special interests of trade unions.
Citizens, it was thought, needed to become more independent; government welfare programs made everyone soft and dependent.
In Thatcher's famous words, there was no "society," only families and individuals to look after themselves.
But the 1945 consensus was dealt a much bigger blow just as we all rejoiced at the collapse of the Soviet empire, the other great tyranny of the twentieth century.
In 1989, it looked as if the dark legacy of World War II, the enslavement of Eastern Europe, was finally over.
And in many ways it was.
But much else collapsed with the Soviet model.
Social democracy lost its raison d "être as an antidote to communism.
Any form of leftist ideology, indeed anything that smelled of collective idealism, was seen as misguided utopianism that could only lead to the gulag.
Neoliberalism filled the vacuum and created enormous wealth for some people, but at the expense of the ideal of equality that emerged from World War II.
The extraordinary reception of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the 21st century shows how clearly the consequences of the collapse of the Left were felt.
In recent years, other ideologies have emerged to satisfy the human need for collective ideals.
The rise of right-wing populism reflects a renewed desire for pure national communities that keep immigrants and minorities away.
And, perversely, American neoconservatives have transformed the internationalism of the old left by trying to impose a democratic world order with US military force.
The answer to these alarming developments is not nostalgia.
We cannot simply go back to the past.
Too much has changed.
But a new quest for social and economic equality and international solidarity is urgently needed.
It cannot be the same as the 1945 Consensus, but we would do well to remember on this anniversary why that Consensus came about in the first place.
One Hundred Years of Incompetence
BERLIN - The global financial and economic crisis that erupted in 2008 was the greatest economic stress test since the Great Depression and the greatest challenge to social and political systems since World War II.
It not only put financial markets and currencies at risk, but also exposed serious regulatory and governance deficiencies that have not yet been fully addressed.
Indeed, the 2008 crisis will most likely be remembered as a turning point, but not because it led to reforms that strengthened economic resilience and eliminated vulnerabilities.
On the contrary, if policymakers fail to recognize, much less follow, the lessons of the Great Recession, it could pave the way for a series of new economic and other crises in the coming decades.
However serious these crises may be, historians will probably despair of our myopia in a century's time.
You will find that analysts and regulators focused closely on repairing the financial system by strengthening national supervisory systems.
This was an honourable goal, as historians will point out, but it was far from the only one.
In order to prepare the world to meet the challenges of globalization and technological development in a way that supports sustainable and equitable growth, governance institutions and regulations at both the national and international levels must be drastically improved.
Yet not nearly enough has been invested in these efforts.
Apart from regional bodies such as the European Union, international financial policy has remained largely untouched.
Worse, because the partial corrections to the financial system will allow even more globalization, they will ultimately make matters worse, as the burden of already inadequate governance and regulatory frameworks increases, not only in finance, but also in other economic and technological areas.
Meanwhile, huge financial investment focused on securing higher returns is likely to fuel technological innovation and further strain regulatory systems in finance and beyond.
Great technological advances, fueled by cheap money, can cause markets to change so quickly that politics and institutional change cannot keep pace.
And new markets may emerge that offer enormous benefits to early adopters or investors who benefit from being several steps ahead of national and international regulators.
This is exactly what happened in the run-up to the 2008 crisis.
New technology-based financial instruments opened up the possibility for some to earn huge sums.
But regulators have been unable to keep pace with innovation, ultimately creating risks that have affected the economy as a whole.
This points to a fundamental difference between the global crises of the twenty-first century and, say, the Great Depression of the 1930s, or indeed all previous stock market crashes.
As the financial sector grows, more actors benefit from under-regulation and weak governance in the short term, making it more difficult to prevent today's crises.
To make matters worse, the systems affected by today's crises go far beyond the competence of a regulator.
This makes crises much more unpredictable, and their consequences - including their long-term impact on society and politics - harder to predict.
The next crises, made more likely by rising nationalism and a growing disregard for science and evidence-based policies, may be financial in nature, but they could also affect areas as diverse as migration, trade, cyberspace, pollution, and climate change.
In all these areas, national and international governance institutions are weak or incomplete, and few independent actors, such as watchdog groups, are demanding transparency and accountability.
This makes it more difficult not only to prevent crises - not least because it offers actors opportunities to play the system and shirk responsibility - but also to respond to them.
The 2008 crisis highlighted how poorly we are at responding quickly to disasters, especially those fueled by fragmented governance.
True, as the Hertie School's 2018 Governance Report shows, there have been some improvements in crisis preparation and management.
But we need to be more vigilant about how developments in a wide range of areas - from finance to digital technologies to climate change - can escape the control capacities of national and international institutions.
We should implement crisis scenarios and develop contingency plans for upheaval in all of these areas, and take stronger steps to mitigate risks, including by managing debt levels that are much higher in advanced countries today than before the 2008 crisis.
We should also ensure that we equip international institutions with the necessary resources and responsibilities.
And by punishing those who aggravate risks for the sake of their own interests, we would strengthen the legitimacy of global governance and the institutions that are supposed to implement it.
As it stands, inadequate cross-border coordination and enforcement of international agreements is a major obstacle to crisis prevention and management.
But, far from remedying this weakness, the world is reviving an outdated model of national sovereignty that makes various crises more likely.
If we do not change course soon, the world of 2118 will have much reason to look at us with contempt.
2011: My Space Odyssey
MOSCOW - Most people who know me think of me as an IT expert who probably lives in California and invests in edgy Internet start-ups.
In fact, my official residence is in New York City, but I will spend the majority of the next five months in Russia and train as a cosmonaut in Star City, just outside Moscow.
It all came about in a number of ways.
First of all, as a child, I simply assumed that I would fly to the moon without having to do much for it.
I just assumed that space travel would be a commonplace thing until I was 40.
My father was involved in the United States space program, and we had some lunar rocks at home, so I thought that was no big deal.
Then I was distracted for 40 years.
A few years ago, however, I started paying attention to space again.
Many people I knew in the IT industry did the same: Elon Musk, a co-founder of PayPal, founded Space-X.
Amazon's Jeff Bezos founded a space company called Blue Origin.
Jeff Greason, a senior executive at Intel, founded XCOR Aerospace (in which I am an investor).
In 2005, the last year I held my PC Forum Conference for IT entrepreneurs, I launched a conference called Flight School for space and private aviation entrepreneurs.
Around 2005, I was in South Africa with a small group advising former President Thabo Mbeki and his government on its IT policy.
One of them was Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Thawte (sold to VeriSign), who recently returned from a trip to the space station as the second space tourist.
One evening, at sunset, the group sat around a campfire and about 50 African schoolchildren were flown in by bus.
A total of about 100 of us, including President Mbeki, were around a blazing fire.
As soon as it was dark, a screen was set up and Mark showed home videos from space.
He gave a fascinating talk about his adventures, complete with clips in which he floated around, caught bubbles in his mouth and so on.
The children loved it and I am sure that some of them decided to study mathematics and science at that time.
Eventually, I invested in Space Adventures, the company that organised Shuttleworth's journey into space.
Later, I took part in a tour they organized to observe the launch of Charles Simonyi, the fifth (and soon seventh) space tourist, from Baikonur in Kazakhstan.
(Simonyi wrote the Microsoft Word program and now has another start-up, Intentional Software and a foundation as well as a website, CharlesinSpace.org.)
Soon after, I started casually discussing the idea of becoming a replacement cosmonaut with the Space Adventures team.
Yes, I would really like to go, but the journey into space costs 35 to 40 million dollars, while the replacement training costs only three million dollars.
So I had vague thoughts that I might fly into space sometime in 2011 - the year Google co-founder Sergey Brin is supposed to go (very) tentatively.
Space Adventures pushed for 2009, but I was pretty busy.
Then something happened last spring: my sister Emily discovered she had cancer and had a double mastectomy.
(She is doing well now and has just won a mini-marathon.)
A few weeks later, I was confronted with one of these conflicts: a board meeting here, a conference there, another opportunity at the same time elsewhere.
Lots of grief!
I realised my priorities were completely out of kilter.
So this sabbatical in Russia is strangely my alternative to a double mastectomy - certainly a positive, but the same kind of reset button experience.
A comeback strategy for Europe
STOCKHOLM / MADRID - When Pope Francis addressed the European Parliament last November, he compared the European Union to a grandmother "pleasant and rich in experience, but without the vitality and energy of the past."
It is high time, Francis said, that EU leaders shed their sleepy image, recognize the strategic challenges facing Europe, and forge clear policies to address them.
Admittedly, the Pope's characterization was shockingly accurate in some respects.
But, despite its apparent inertia, Europe retains considerable strengths.
It is a centre for high-level thinking and innovation; it is home to some of the world's most competitive regions and industries; and, perhaps most impressively, it has built a community and a market comprising half a billion people.
But the world is changing: the Asia-Pacific region is increasingly influencing global developments, economic developments, and others.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership, through which the United States and 11 other countries would create a supra-regional free-trade area, would most likely accelerate this transition (all the more so if China eventually joins).
Although the TPP has no hurdles to overcome before reaching an agreement, its potential to strengthen Asia's economic power cannot be underestimated.
Europe must work to secure its position in the new world order, starting with strengthening its own trade and investment relations with the US.
The problem is that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) talks in the TPP negotiations are so deeply entangled in domestic political controversy that the entire project could well fail.
Business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic are convinced that a successful TTIP agreement would bring significant economic benefits - a perception that many studies support.
Nevertheless, trivial issues such as the use of chlorinated chicken and the settlement of investor disputes continue to dominate the debate.
The TTIP aims to unleash the power of the transatlantic economy, which remains by far the largest and richest market in the world, accounting for three-quarters of global financial activity and more than half of world trade.
(If TTIP were opened to other economies, such as Turkey, Mexico, and Canada, the benefits would be even greater.)
Even more compelling than the benefits of an agreement, however, are the potentially catastrophic consequences of failure.
For starters, a breakdown in TTIP talks would provide considerable ammunition to those in the UK who want to leave the EU; conversely, it would be unwise, and therefore unlikely, for the UK to leave the EU if TTIP were implemented.
Moreover, the perception that the EU's internal strife has led to a missed strategic opportunity would likely prompt the US to accelerate its withdrawal from the continent.
And Russian President Vladimir Putin would inevitably see the EU's failure as a great opportunity to exert more influence over parts of Europe.
All of this contributes to a stark strategic risk: if TTIP falters or collapses as the TPP advances and succeeds, the global balance will tip heavily in Asia's favor, and Europe will have little, if any, chance of regaining its economic and geopolitical clout.
When TTIP was first proposed, Europe seemed to recognize its value.
Indeed, it was the EU that, in June 2013, urged the US, which initially doubted Europe's commitment, to begin the negotiation process.
The aim was to conclude negotiations on a gas tank.
No one wanted to endure protracted talks or the political pain that comes with them.
But EU leaders essentially abandoned the project, seemingly confirming American fears.
Trade negotiators struggled to make progress, while anti-globalization activists seized control of public discourse, portraying TTIP as a threat to everything from Europe's democracy to its health.
This is dangerously inaccurate talk, and EU leaders must prevent it from gaining traction by making the strategic case for the agreement.
And they must renew their commitment to conclude the talks successfully in 2015.
This is not to say that resolving the remaining issues in the TTIP negotiations will be easy.
But concluding a trade agreement, especially one that involves so many regulatory issues, is always difficult, because it must take into account the complexity and changeability of modern economies.
The fact is that the challenges of completing TTIP are no more intractable than those faced by EU leaders in the final years of the crisis.
When TTIP negotiations resume next month, EU leaders must push for real progress with the goal of concluding an agreement by the end of the year.
The good news is that the recent midterm elections in the US may have improved their chances.
President Barack Obama could now get fast-track negotiating authorization from Congress.
If it does, Congress would simply approve or reject any negotiated agreement, rather than dismantle it.
The US presidential election season is beginning, and other issues in the new year could easily take over the EU agenda.
That is why European leaders have no time to lose.
They must seize economic opportunities and avert a strategic catastrophe.
Another slow year for the global economy
WASHINGTON, DC - Last April, the International Monetary Fund projected that the global economy would grow by 3.5% in 2015.
In the months that followed, this forecast was steadily revised downwards, reaching 3.1% in October.
But the IMF insists, with almost trite predictability, that next year will be better, as it has been for the past seven years.
But she is almost certainly wrong again.
For starters, world trade is growing at an anemic annual rate of 2%, compared to 8% from 2003 to 2007.
While trade growth in these heady years far exceeded that of global GDP, which averaged 4.5%, growth rates for trade and GDP have recently been roughly the same.
Even if GDP growth exceeds trade growth this year, it is unlikely to exceed 2.7%.
The question is why.
According to Christina and David Romer of the University of California, Berkeley, the aftershocks of modern financial crises, that is, since World War II, subside after two to three years.
Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff say it takes five years for a country to emerge from a financial crisis.
And, indeed, the financial dislocations of 2007-2008 have largely subsided.
So what is the reason for the sluggish economic recovery?
A popular explanation lies in the vague notion of "secular stagnation": long-term subdued demand for goods and services undermines incentives for investment and hiring.
But demand would remain weak only if people did not have confidence in the future.
The only logical explanation for this persistent lack of confidence, as Robert Gordon of Northwestern University has meticulously documented and argued, is slow productivity growth.
Before the crisis, and especially between 2003 and 2007, slow productivity growth in much of the world was obscured by an illusory sense of prosperity.
In some countries, in particular the United States, Spain and Ireland, rising house prices, speculative construction and financial risk-taking mutually reinforced each other.
At the same time, the countries mutually reinforced each other through trade.
Central to the global boom was China, the rising giant that flooded the world with cheap exports and put a lid on global inflation.
Equally important, China imported huge amounts of raw materials, strengthening many African and Latin American economies, buying German cars and machinery, and keeping Europe's largest economy humming its regional supply chains.
That dynamic reversed around March 2008, when the US rescued Bear Stearns, its fifth-largest investment bank, from collapse.
With eurozone banks deeply mired in the mortgage mess and desperately short of US dollars, America and much of Europe began a merciless slide into recession.
Whereas in the boom years world trade had distributed the bounty, it now spread the discomfort.
As individual countries "GDP growth slowed, so did the growth of imports, which also slowed the growth of trading partners.
The US economy began to emerge from recession in the second half of 2009, largely thanks to aggressive monetary policy and measures to stabilize the financial system.
Eurozone policymakers, by contrast, rejected monetary stimulus and implemented austerity, while ignoring their banks "deepening woes.
The eurozone has thus pushed the world into a second global recession.
Just when this recession seemed to have run its course, emerging economies began to unravel.
For years, observers had touted the governance and growth-enhancing reforms that these countries had supposedly introduced.
In October 2012, the IMF praised the resilience of emerging economies.
At the touch of a button, that façade began to crumble, revealing an uncomfortable truth: factors such as high commodity prices and massive capital inflows had masked serious economic weaknesses, while legitimizing a culture of glaring inequality and rampant corruption.
These problems are now being exacerbated by the slowdown in growth in China, the linchpin of world trade.
And the worst is yet to come.
China's vast industrial overcapacity and property glut must be reduced, the hubris that drives its global takeovers must be contained, and its corruption networks must be dismantled.
In short, the factors that dragged the global economy down in 2015 will persist and, in some cases, intensify in the new year.
Emerging markets will remain weak.
The eurozone, which has enjoyed a temporary respite from austerity, is constrained by listless world trade.
Rising interest rates on corporate bonds point to slower growth in the US.
China's collapsing assets could trigger financial turmoil.
And policymakers are indecisive and have little political leverage to stem these trends.
The IMF should stop predicting renewed growth and issue a warning that the global economy will remain weak and fragile unless world leaders act vigorously to spur innovation and growth.
Trump's uncertainty
NEW YORK - Every January, I try to forecast the year ahead.
Economic forecasting is notoriously difficult, but regardless of the truth expressed in Harry Truman's call for a one-armed economist (who, on the other hand, would be unable to say so), my record was credible.
In recent years, I correctly predicted that the recovery from the Great Recession of 2008 would be slow without stronger fiscal stimulus (which was not expected in either Europe or the United States).
In making these forecasts, I have relied more on analysis of underlying economic forces than on complex econometric models.
In early 2016, for example, it seemed clear that the shortfalls in global aggregate demand that had manifested themselves in recent years were unlikely to change dramatically.
So I thought forecasters of a stronger recovery were looking at the world through rose-tinted spectacles.
The economic development went largely as I had expected.
Not so the political events of 2016.
I had written for years that failing to address rising inequality - particularly in the US, but also in many other countries around the world - would have political consequences.
But inequality continued to worsen, with striking data showing that average life expectancy in the US was declining.
These findings were anticipated by a study last year by Anne Case and Angus Deaton, which showed that life expectancy was declining for large segments of the population - including America's so-called angry men in the Rust Belt.
But, with the incomes of the bottom 90% stagnating (and declining for a significant part) for nearly a third of the century, the health data merely confirmed that things were not going well in very large parts of the country.
And while America may be at the forefront of this trend, it has hardly looked better elsewhere.
But when it seemed clear that there would be political consequences, its form and timing were far less obvious.
Why did the backlash in the US come just when the economy seemed to be on the mend, and not sooner?
And why has it manifested itself in a shift to the right?
After all, it was Republicans who blocked aid to those who lost their jobs as a result of the globalization they relentlessly pushed.
It was Republicans who refused to allow the expansion of Medicaid in 26 states, denying health insurance to those at the lower end of the income scale.
And why was the victor someone who made a living exploiting others, openly admitted not paying his fair share of tax, and made tax avoidance a point of pride?
Donald Trump understood the spirit of the times: things were not going well, and many voters wanted change.
Now they will get it: there will be no business as usual.
But seldom has there been more uncertainty.
What policies Trump will pursue remains unknown, let alone what will succeed or what the consequences will be.
Trump seems obsessed with a trade war.
But how will China and Mexico respond?
Trump may understand that his proposals violate World Trade Organization rules, but he may also know that it will take a long time for the WTO to rule against him.
And by then, America's trade balance could be back in balance.
But two can play this game: China can take similar action, though its response is likely to be more subtle.
What would happen if a trade war broke out?
Trump may have reason to believe that he can win; after all, China is more dependent on exports to the US than the US is on exports to China, giving the US an advantage.
But a trade war is not a zero-sum game.
The US, too, could lose.
China could use its retaliatory measures more effectively to cause acute political pain.
And the Chinese may be in a better position to respond to US attempts to inflict pain on them than the US to respond to the pain that China might inflict on the Americans.
Anyone can guess who can endure the pain better.
Will it be the US, where ordinary citizens have been suffering for so long, or China, which, despite troubled times, has managed to generate growth of more than 6%?
More broadly, the Republican / Trump agenda, with its tax cuts targeting the rich even more than the standard Republican prescription would imply, is based on the idea of "trickle-down" prosperity - a continuation of the Reagan-era supply-side economy that never really worked.
Fire-breathing rhetoric or exuberant tweets at three o'clock in the morning might ease the anger of those left behind by the Reagan revolution, at least for a while.
But for how much longer?
And then what happens?
Trump could repeal the normal laws of economics if he pursues his version of voodoo economics.
But he can't.
Nonetheless, with the world's largest economy entering uncharted political territory in 2017 and beyond, it would be foolish for an ordinary mortal to venture a forecast other than to say the obvious: the waters will almost certainly be stormy, and many, if not most, expert ships will sink along the way.
9 / 11 and the new authoritarianism
Five years after the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, September 11 is no longer a mere date.
It has entered the history books as the beginning of something new, perhaps a new era, but certainly a time of change.
The terrorist attacks in Madrid, London and elsewhere will also be remembered, but it is September 11 that has become a buzzword, almost like August 1914.
But was it really a war that began on September 11, 2001?
Not everyone is happy about this American idea.
During the heyday of Irish terrorism in Britain, successive British governments tried to avoid giving the IRA the idea that war was being waged. < unk > War < unk > would have meant accepting the terrorists as legitimate enemies, in a sense equal in a bloody contest for which there are accepted rules of engagement.
This is neither a correct description nor useful terminology for terrorist acts that are more accurately described as criminal.
By calling them war and naming an adversary, usually al-Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden, the US government has justified domestic changes that would have been unacceptable in any free country before the September 11 attacks.
Most of these changes were enshrined in the so-called USA Patriot Act.
Although some of the changes were merely administrative, the Patriot Act as a whole eroded the great pillars of freedom, such as habeas corpus, the right to appeal to an independent court when the state deprives an individual of his or her liberty.
The Guantánamo Bay detention centre in Cuba became an early symbol of something unheard of: the detention without trial of "illegal combatants" deprived of all human rights.
The world now wonders how many of these non-human people there are in how many places.
For everyone else, a kind of state of emergency has been declared, allowing state interference with basic civil rights.
Border controls have become an ordeal for many, and police persecution has become a burden for many.
A climate of fear has made life difficult for anyone who looks suspicious or acts suspiciously, especially Muslims.
Such restrictions on freedom met with little public opposition when they were adopted.
On the contrary, by and large, it was the critics, not the advocates of these measures, who ran into trouble.
In the United Kingdom, where Prime Minister Tony Blair fully supported the US position, the government introduced similar measures and even offered a new theory.
Blair was the first to argue that security was the first freedom.
In other words, freedom is not the right of the individual to determine his own life, but the right of the state to restrict individual freedom in the name of a security that only the state can define.
This is the beginning of a new authoritarianism.
The problem exists in all the countries affected by the threat of terrorism, although in many countries it has not become quite so specific.
In most continental European countries, 11 September has remained an American date.
There is even a debate - and indeed some evidence - about whether participation in the "war on terrorism" has actually increased the threat of terrorist attacks.
The Germans are certainly using this argument to stay out of the action.
However, this attitude has not prevented the spread of something that also uses a German word in other languages: fear.
A diffuse fear is spreading.
People feel uncomfortable and worried, especially when travelling.
Every train crash or plane crash is now initially suspected of being an act of terrorism.
Thus, directly or indirectly, 11 September was a major shock, both psychologically and for our political systems.
While terrorism is being fought in the name of democracy, the fight has actually led to a significant weakening of democracy, owing to official laws and the fear of the population.
One of the worrying features of the September 11 attacks is that it is difficult to see their purpose beyond the perpetrators "resentment of the West and its way.
But the West's core characteristics, democracy and the rule of law, have been hit far harder by its defenders than by its attackers.
Above all, two steps are needed to restore confidence in freedom in the democracies affected by the legacy of 11 September.
Firstly, we must ensure that the relevant legislation to meet the challenge of terrorism is only temporary.
Some of today's restrictions on habeas corpus and civil liberties have opt-out clauses that limit their validity; all of these rules should be reviewed regularly by parliaments.
Secondly, and more importantly, our politicians must try to allay public fears rather than exploit them.
The terrorists with whom we are now at war cannot win, because their dark vision will never gain broad public legitimacy.
This is yet another reason for democrats to defend our values - first and foremost by acting in accordance with them.
A Portfolio Approach to Climate Change
The world has tried, with little success, to reduce CO2 emissions under the Kyoto Protocol.
The enormous effort involved in the entry into force of the Protocol nevertheless shows how much work will be needed to prepare the next treaty, which is due to be adopted in Copenhagen in December 2009.
Campaigners will push for tough and far-reaching policies, but there will continue to be strong opposition from countries concerned about their economic vitality.
The new negotiations will have an advantage over previous efforts, because governments now understand the need for a portfolio of adaptation, mitigation, and research efforts.
New research that my colleagues and I have conducted for the Copenhagen Consensus Center in Denmark examines the effectiveness of different responses to this global challenge, but they strongly support the portfolio approach for several reasons.
First, we now know that adaptation will be indispensable, because temperatures will rise another 0.6 ° C by 2100, even if greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated tomorrow.
We also know that the effects of climate change will not be evenly distributed across the globe.
In some areas, moderately warmer temperatures could lead to higher yields if associated changes in rainfall patterns are not detrimental and / or irrigation remains viable.
But even with 0.6 ° C warming, Africa and South Asia will almost immediately experience a reduction in the viability of many crops and, ultimately, increased susceptibility to infectious diseases.
These impacts will clearly hit the poorest inhabitants of the planet hardest: the bottom billion, who already bear the brunt of disease, poverty, conflict, and malnutrition.
A key challenge, therefore, is to ensure that adaptability is expanded and used where it is most needed.
Long-term development may give countries more opportunities to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment and citizens "health, but in the meantime, the world's poorest will need help from the rich.
For example, our analysis examined the merits of targeted strategies for the near future: purchasing mosquito-resistant bed nets and oral malaria rehydration for children in the poorest countries affected by climate change.
The aim was to deal proactively and proactively with some of the marginal health effects of global warming.
The benefits would appear almost immediately, but would evaporate over time as economies evolved.
But even if development improves conditions, reducing carbon dioxide emissions would become more important in the longer term as the effects of climate change become more severe.
Since the effects of climate change have been observed in many parts of the world, it makes sense to think about mitigation everywhere.
But we found that damage limitation alone was not sufficient for a standard cost-benefit assessment.
We have allowed the specified annual cost of climate policy to rise proportionally to global GDP, originally $18 billion a year, by 2100.
The discounted cost of the resulting annual fixed costs totaled $800 billion, but the losses avoided by this approach amounted to a discounted value of only $685 billion.
The Copenhagen Consensus study also looked at a portfolio option announced by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
We allocated $50 billion to research into greener technologies, so that only $750 billion could be absorbed by the economic costs of adaptation and mitigation.
The gap between the costs of zero-carbon and carbon-emitting technology has narrowed, and taxes on emissions have become more effective.
As a result, the research and development program has largely paid for itself, with the total discounted benefits for the $800 billion investment rising to more than $2.1 trillion.
Ensuring that research and development is part of the global portfolio to combat climate change would make efforts to mitigate climate change more efficient and significantly improve their ability to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the next century.
But these favorable net benefits reflect very conservative assumptions about the timing of emission reductions and when developing countries would come on board.
Optimizing investment in the portfolio over time, for example, would more than triple the discounted benefit.
The expected benefits would increase further if we included the possibility that potentially higher climate sensitivities would exacerbate the damage, although this would require the inclusion of similarly plausible lower climate sensitivities that would push in the opposite direction.
Fighting climate change can be a sound investment, even if neither mitigation nor adaptation alone will be enough to solve the problem.
To make a real difference, especially in the short term, the world needs to combine mitigation and adaptation with increased research and development into carbon-saving and sequestration technology, which in turn requires the development and use of market-based incentives.
A "reset button" for Europe's backyard
STOCKHOLM - A year after last August's war in Georgia, pressing the "reset" button for diplomatic relations is now a popular endeavor.
President Barack Obama recently traveled to Moscow to revive strained US-Russia relations.
Although the European Union does not need a "fresh start," owing to its tense relations with its eastern neighbours, it is engaged in a profound strategic reconstruction of these relations.
When the EU launched its new "Eastern Partnership" in May, the aim was to promote further integration with the Union's six immediate eastern neighbours - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.
The global financial crisis had made an updated and strengthened policy for the EU's Eastern Neighbourhood an urgent necessity.
Equally important was the fact that all the countries concerned expressed an ambition to move closer to the EU.
The Eastern Partnership, resulting from a Polish-Swedish initiative, offers the six countries a substantial improvement and deepening of relations with the EU in key areas.
In trade and economic relations, it clearly sets out the objective of creating deep and comprehensive free trade areas between the EU and partner countries.
It confirms full visa liberalisation as a long-term objective (with visa facilitation agreements in the meantime), promises enhanced cooperation on energy security, diversification and efficiency, and has dedicated programmes and projects to help neighbours in their integration and reform efforts in all these areas.
Sweden's assumption of the EU presidency this month should help.
However, it comes at a time when the Union's Eastern Neighbourhood is facing major challenges and the financial and economic crisis is hitting many of the partner countries hard.
Ukraine is suffering from a sharp decline in global demand and trade, which is seriously undermining its steel industry.
Georgia's economic success is largely based on foreign direct investment, for which there is now little appetite.
Partner countries less integrated into the world market, such as Moldova, have seen the crisis come more slowly, but the real impact could be just as severe, and they are likely to recover more slowly.
The Eastern Partnership does not offer quick solutions to the crisis.
But it can provide a policy framework and support for institution-building to address the shortcomings that have made these countries so vulnerable to the crisis: imperfect market economies, weak state institutions, and persistent corruption.
The Eastern Partnership's offer of deep integration with the EU in areas such as trade and energy is transformative.
The other type of crisis that most partner countries are going through is a political one.
In most of these countries, democratic development has not yet reached the point where a change of government is routine in political life and can take place without jeopardising the stability of the country.
The Eastern Partnership is based on the fundamental values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
Political association with the EU and the integration process within this partnership will promote reforms in these key areas.
The Swedish EU Presidency will focus on starting concrete work on the foundations of the partnership.
The establishment of "Comprehensive Institution Building Programmes" to support the reform of key institutions in each partner country should take place before the end of the year.
Some flagship initiatives proposed by the European Commission will finally see the light of day and new projects and initiatives should be developed.
Sweden will attach particular importance to energy efficiency programmes, which will not only improve energy security and reduce costs, but will also make an important contribution to the fight against climate change.
The Swedish Presidency intends to organise, together with the European Commission, the first meeting of the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum this autumn.
We look forward to the start of parliamentary cooperation and exchanges between the local and regional authorities of the thirty-three EU and partner countries.
At the end of the year, a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers and their counterparts from the six partner countries will assess the progress made so far and provide guidance on the way forward.
The Eastern Partnership is about the integration of the EU, about the six countries converging on the values, laws and working methods of the EU, and about the EU being there to support and support this convergence.
In Russia, the impression is sometimes given that the partnership is directed against them.
But that's not true, of course.
On the contrary, Russia, like Turkey, will be welcome to participate in relevant activities within the multilateral dimension of the partnership.
The Eastern Partnership is not an answer to all the problems and difficulties facing the six partners.
Nevertheless, it represents a clear commitment by the EU to support its transition and reforms politically and economically - a process that should bring prosperity and stability to the entire region.
A "Third Way" to Confrontation with Russia
PARIS < unk > Let's engage Russia if we can, but contain it if we have to. < unk > These two alternatives defined Western strategy toward Russia back in the mid-1990s.
Russia may have changed dramatically since then, but not our questions about what to do if its great neighbour widens the gap between its culture, which is European, and its political system, which is becoming increasingly Asian, at least in the evil old sense of Oriental despotism.
Should the best response to the return of Russia's imperial ambitions be a modern version of a sacred alliance of stability designed to contain the world's new outsider?
Or is there a need for a conference in Yalta aimed at redrawing Europe's political boundaries?
Could the answer be a bit of both?
If Russia becomes what revolutionary France was under Napoleon, or returns to the Soviet form, cut off from a totalitarian ideology but striving for conquest and reconquest, it does not need the League of Democracies advocated by some conservatives in America.
Instead, what is needed is a "stability league," with prominent players such as China, India, and other countries more interested in economic growth than in shaking up the international system.
Such a strategy implies, first and foremost, a solid partnership with China, not because it is moving toward democracy, but because it is a status quo power.
Such a strategy could lead to the opening of negotiations with Iran and, of course, a further closing of ranks within NATO.
The message to the Kremlin would be crystal clear.
Make no mistake: nationalism and imperialism will take you nowhere; you cannot expand geographically without causing serious costs for your economic growth and personal enrichment.
Europe may be weak and divided, America may no longer be what it once was, but with your declining population and the sorry state of your economy beyond oil and gas, you are simply not equipped to play in the league of global superpowers.
It's China, not you.
But the containment argument fails because the Kremlin can still wreak havoc around the world by acting irresponsibly with Syria or Venezuela.
More importantly, turning the world against Russia alone would mean taking Russia's great-power aspirations too seriously.
For example, many Asians believe that Russia is a problem for Europe, but no longer for the world.
At the end of the Cold War, Japan remained obsessed with Russia as the heir to the Soviet Union.
Today, the Japanese are so concerned about China that they have little time to fear Russia.
The other alternative to a rebirth of containment would be to accept Russia's reasoning, or, more precisely, Russia's emotions.
In effect, this means: "We have humiliated you unnecessarily over the last ten years."
From NATO enlargement to the granting of Kosovo's independence, we have deliberately ignored your sensitivities and interests.
Let us sit down like Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin at Yalta and redraw a map of twenty-first century Europe.
What do you want back?
What do we keep?
This approach could recognize Russia's droit de regard for the future development of the Caucasus.
Indeed, under the leadership of Nicolas Sarkozy's France, which currently holds the EU Presidency, Europe has de facto resigned itself to the dismemberment of Georgia.
Russian troops are to remain in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
The West is not declaring war on Russia for the sake of Georgia, whose credibility has been greatly undermined by its president's irresponsible behavior.
As for Ukraine, it could one day become part of the European Union, but its future does not lie in NATO.
But a third way must be found between comprehensive containment, which is very unlikely and not necessarily desirable or realistic, and a concession that borders on appeasement and would be dangerous for Europe's future, based on a few firm principles.
These principles are clear.
First, Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable.
This has been said many times, but the repetition does not diminish its significance.
Russia without Ukraine is a manageable nation-state;
Russia with Ukraine is an unmanageable empire.
Second, the Kremlin's shameless brutality is unacceptable, even if the West condemns Georgia's irresponsibility and includes Russia's sensitivities about the complex historical feelings surrounding its former imperial territories in its policies.
After all, this is Europe more than six decades after World War II and almost 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The use of force to settle scores and impose the will of one nation on another cannot be tolerated passively.
In the short term, time may be on Russia's side.
In the long term, time is on our side economically, demographically, politically and strategically if we stick to our values and principles.
A Yes to Euroscepticism
The turmoil that plagued many governments in the recent European Parliament elections puts them in a difficult position ahead of this week's EU summit.
Only an incurable optimist can hope that the summit will bring glory to any of them.
The Summit has two objectives: to finalise the text of a new EU Constitution and to appoint the next President of the Commission.
These negotiations will be much more difficult given the spectacular rejection at the ballot box of a number of major governments, as well as the sharp rise in protests and eurosceptic parties in several member states.
The problem for Europe's politicians is that their own rejection by voters does not necessarily convey the same message as the rise of Eurosceptic parties.
The record-breaking drop in votes for Gerhard Schröder's ruling Social Democrats in Germany has little to do with his European policies, but much to do with the perceived failure of his economic policies - and persistently low growth and high unemployment - at home.
Despite the success of nationalist parties in France, the same is true of President Jacques Chirac's centre-right party.
In Britain, by contrast, where the economy is strong and unemployment is low, anger over Tony Blair's determination to go to war in Iraq alongside George Bush was the main factor in the decline in votes for the ruling Labour Party.
Nevertheless, the rise of Eurosceptic parties in a number of countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Poland, and the Czech Republic, has worrying implications for a summit aimed at taking a small but distinctive step forward in European integration.
In the United Kingdom, in particular, the spectacular rise of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) can only reinforce the government's long-latent Euroscepticism.
The proposed Constitution will contain a Charter of Fundamental Rights to strengthen the EU's political and moral legitimacy.
But will it really strengthen the rights of EU citizens?
Or, as the British government insists, it will simply be a declaratory document describing only rights that already exist in member states because of national laws.
The draft Constitution would strengthen the political decision-making powers of the Union, with slightly more majority voting in the Council of Ministers and a stronger role for the European Parliament.
But, despite Tony Blair's unique declaration that he would lead Britain "to the heart of Europe," he remains vehemently opposed to the prospect of further integration, and will oppose any new encroachment on British sovereignty in his "red lines" on taxes, foreign policy, and EU budget financing.
Blair's Euroscepticism is understandable in that it fits the British mood.
Opinion polls consistently show that British voters are not enthusiastic about the EU, and the picture is confirmed by the latest Eurobarometer survey carried out across the Union on behalf of the Commission, but before the recent enlargement from 15 to 25 Member States.
One question that is always asked in this survey is whether voters tend to trust or distrust various institutions, such as national parliaments, national governments, and the European Union.
Overall, confidence in the European Union is not high: only 41% of voters tend to trust the EU, while 42% tend not to trust it.
But in the UK, the figures are dramatically different: only 19% trust the EU, while 55% distrust it.
By contrast, the European Parliament has a better reputation than the EU as a whole: the average EU-wide trust in the European Parliament is 54%, while in the UK it is 30%.
Across the EU, 48% think EU membership is a good thing, compared to 29% in the UK.
On virtually every issue, British voters are less enthusiastic about the EU than voters in any other country.
One might think that British distaste for the EU would be reflected in the support and pride in their national institutions.
This is not the case.
British confidence in the European Parliament may be only 30%, but confidence in the Westminster Parliament is much lower, at just 19% - the lowest in the EU.
Trust in national government is slightly higher, but still only 25%, while trust in national political parties is only 10%.
Both figures are the lowest in the EU.
Voters in other countries have more confidence in the EU institutions, but their opinion of their own institutions is also low.
In France, 57% trust the European Parliament, but only 29% trust the French Parliament, compared with 51% and 23% in Germany.
But the conundrum of the survey is that even if Europe's voters were not enthusiastic about the EU and its existing institutions in their current form, 65% of them would support a common foreign policy for Europe, and 72% would support a common defense and security policy; even in the United Kingdom, 52% support the idea of a common defense policy.
This may be a reaction to the American-led war in Iraq, but it is precisely for this reason that Tony Blair will rule it out, and a common European defence policy without Britain makes little sense.
The dilemma for European leaders at this week's summit is that they are on the cusp of an unstable process of European integration.
With the accession of ten new members, the EU must become more integrated if it is to function.
But it is far from clear that those governments that would normally support more integration can sell it to disillusioned voters.
Tony Blair has promised a referendum on the new EU constitution that he cannot possibly win.
The key question will be whether Europe's "leaders" deliberately gamble on failure in the hope that the problem will disappear.
Bad deal for America's future
WASHINGTON, DC - The painstakingly negotiated US budget bill that President Barack Obama signed into law on August 2 combines an increase in the federal debt ceiling with a reduction in federal spending, averting the prospect of the first default in the United States "224-year history.
But the agreement has three major shortcomings.
Two balance each other, but the third threatens what America needs most in the years ahead: economic growth.
The first mistake is that the spending cuts are ill-timed: if the US economy is weak, they risk triggering another recession.
The second shortcoming of the measure, however, is that the spending cuts it imposes are modest.
Although the law does too little to solve America's chronic and rising budget deficits, the damage it is doing to the economy in the short term is likely to be limited.
The third and most damaging mistake, however, is that the spending cuts are taking place in the wrong places.
With congressional Democrats almost religiously committed to keeping America's most important social programs for seniors, Social Security and Medicare, intact, the law affects neither.
The cost of these programs will rise sharply, as the 78 million-strong baby boom generation of those born between 1946 and 1964 retires and receives benefits, accounting for the largest increase in government spending and projected deficits in years to come.
And, because Republicans in Congress have an equally pronounced allergy to tax increases, at all times and under all circumstances, the bill's deficit reduction is not based on tax increases at all - not even for the wealthiest Americans.
All the spending cuts come from the "discretionary" federal budget, which excludes Social Security, Medicare, the Medicaid program for the poor and interest on the national debt.
That leaves only about one-third of total federal spending, much of which goes to the defense budget that Republicans will try to protect in the future.
As a result, the structure created by the August 2 law focuses on the "discretionary non-defense part" of the federal budget, which accounts for only about 10% of it.
This is too small a pool of money to achieve the level of deficit reduction that the US will need in the coming years.
Worse, discretionary non-defense spending includes programs indispensable to economic growth, and economic growth is indispensable to America's future prosperity and global standing.
Growth is first and foremost the best way to reduce the country's budget deficits.
The higher the growth rate, the more revenue the government raises without raising tax rates, and higher revenues enable smaller deficits.
Moreover, economic growth is necessary to keep the promise, "enormously important to individual Americans," that each generation will have the chance to become wealthier than the previous one, whose popular term is "the American dream."
Equally important for non-Americans, only robust economic growth can ensure that the US maintains its expansionary role in the world, which supports the global economy and contributes to stability in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East.
As Thomas L. Friedman and I explain in our forthcoming book, That Used To Be Us: How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented and How We Can Come Back, a key factor in America's economic success has been an ongoing public-private partnership dating back to the country's founding, endangered by the pattern of budget cuts set by the August 2 law.
This partnership has five components: greater educational opportunities to produce top-skill workers; investment in infrastructure, roads, power plants, and ports that support trade; funds for research and development to broaden knowledge boundaries in ways that produce new products; an immigration policy that attracts and retains talented people from outside America; and corporate regulations strong enough to prevent disasters like the near-collapse of the financial system in 2008, but not so severe that they stifle the risk-taking and innovation that generates growth.
The first three elements of America's growth formula cost money, and that money is contained in the "discretionary non-defense" part of the federal budget that is now being targeted by the debt-ceiling bill.
Cutting these programs will reduce American economic growth in the long run, with negative consequences both at home and abroad.
Reducing the deficit by cutting funding for education, infrastructure and research and development is akin to trying to lose weight by cutting off three fingers.
Most of the weight will remain and life prospects will have deteriorated significantly.
Reducing deficits to raise the debt ceiling was the right thing to do, but the August 2 law does it in the wrong way.
If the inevitable further deficit reduction does not result from curbing benefits and increasing revenues, rather than from programs that are essential to economic growth, the result will be a poorer, weaker US economy and a more uncertain, if not unstable, world.
A balanced EU Constitution
European Commission President Romano Prodi has proposed a programme to strengthen the executive power of the Union.
Britain, France, and Spain are working on an opposing plan to consolidate the EU's executive powers among the largest EU states.
What should ordinary Europeans think?
European citizens hardly understand the issues at the heart of the European Constitutional Convention in Brussels.
Mountains of detail obscure problems; sterile, misleading national debates pitting "Eurosceptics" against "Europhiles" generate sound and fury, but clarify nothing.
Many issues appear to be so complicated that some newspapers and broadcasters have given up reporting on the Convention.
EU citizens can gain a clearer understanding of what the Convention should achieve by asking this question: How should government functions be divided between the EU and its member states?
To answer this, we need to understand the true purpose of government.
The state should provide citizens with public goods: collective defence, legislation and regulation, enforcement of the rule of law.
These can be provided at different levels: local, regional, national or supranational, i.e. in the EU.
But what is the right level?
In some areas decentralisation works because it recognises different local or national communities.
However, local decisions often have an impact on citizens in other communities.
Certain services should therefore be allocated to a broader geographical unit, because they have externalities (i.e., interdependence of effects).
The allocation of government powers in Europe should be based on the principle that institutions conduct only such activities with clear economies of scale and modest disagreements.
The lower the externalities of government activity, the more it should be localized.
Low externalities imply limited benefits from centralization; deep differences among citizens imply that the costs of harmonization would be too high.
The euro, for example, offers clear economies of scale, as it favours international trade and avoids negative externalities.
The lira can no longer be devalued to favour Italian exports to the detriment of the French, followed by a French reaction, etc.
Although the imperfectly synchronized economic cycles of EU members cause friction in monetary and exchange-rate policies, the benefits of the euro outweigh the costs of diversity.
In education policy, however, imposing the same system on all members would not create economies of scale.
Cultural differences are too great to achieve voluntary compliance, and it would be absurd to delegate education and culture to a supranational level.
Of the areas of public policy with high economies of scale or externalities, two stand out: the common market and competition, and foreign policy and defence.
The first concerns antitrust, trade and the single currency.
Some believe that budgetary policies - from the structure of taxation to the welfare state to balanced budgets - should also be harmonised.
But national preferences are diverse, and if they are mechanically enforced, fiscal centralization could provoke resistance.
Even a centralized fiscal policy has no real raison d "être from a constitutional point of view.
The US Constitution, for example, does not require states to balance their budgets.
Fiscal harmonisation is only justified in exceptional cases: prohibitions, for example, on tax incentives aimed at restricting competition, hindering trade or restricting the movement of capital.
Foreign policy and defence are, par excellence, at the top of government.
There are clear externalities and economies of scale.
It would be absurd for New York to pursue a different foreign policy from Texas.
The same applies to Europe.
The admission of new EU members means that there will be more internal differences, which means that less centralised policies are justified.
These considerations suggest a number of principles which the Convention should take into account:
1. The EU Constitution should clearly define what prerogatives Europe and the Member States are entitled to.
In case of doubt, the principle of subsidiarity proposes that the nation states should prevail.
2. Institutions at European level should ensure the functioning of markets, including competition, trade and monetary policies;
3. Fiscal policy should remain largely decentralised, with a few exceptions;
4. Foreign policy and defence are areas of federal competence which must be delegated to Europe in due course;
5. The creation of new areas of federal competence should be accompanied by decision-making mechanisms to be found in truly representative democracies.
So "no centralisation without representation."
Today's EU deviates enormously from these principles (see table), as shown by the fact that agriculture accounts for 40% of EU expenditure, accounting for 2% of Europe's GDP.

Europe is facing a historic opportunity.
America's founding fathers wrote a constitution that has endured for more than 200 years.
The members of the European Convention obviously face a much more complex and diverse society - and thus a more formidable constitutional challenge.
But they can succeed by displaying comparable wisdom and foresight.
A Balanced Look at Sino-American Imbalances
BEIJING - Before July 2007, most economists agreed that global imbalances were the biggest threat to global growth.
It was argued that the United States "rising net external debt-to-GDP ratio, owing to chronic current-account deficits, would drastically slow capital inflows, which in turn would weaken the dollar, push up interest rates, and plunge the US economy into crisis.
But that scenario failed to materialize.
Instead, the crisis stemmed from the US subprime debacle, which quickly plunged the global economy into its deepest recession since the 1930 "s.
Most economists did not foresee the economic dynamism that actually led to the crisis, because they did not pay enough attention to the rapid increase in total US debt.
Instead, they focused exclusively on US foreign debt, ignoring household debt (mortgage and consumer debt), government debt, corporate debt, and financial debt.
In particular, they should have paid more attention to the sustainability of US mortgage and consumer debt.
In 2007, the ratio of mortgage and consumer debt to GDP was over 90%, compared to 24% for net foreign debt.
Of course, the various components of indebtedness vary considerably in character and sources of financing, and thus in sustainability.
But all parts of a country's total debt and its financing are interlinked.
That means two things.
First, funds from different sources of financing are interchangeable to a certain extent: missing funds for one component of total debt can be supplemented by surplus funds originally intended to finance other components.
Second, problems in any single component of aggregate debt will affect all other components.
After the subprime crisis erupted, households repaid mortgage and consumer debt, either with their savings or through default.
The decline in US aggregate debt and the narrowing of the financing gap between aggregate debt and domestic funds led to a significant improvement in the US current-account deficit in 2008-2009, refuting US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's claim that the deficit was caused by a global savings glut.
Indeed, despite the dollar's appreciation, America's current-account position has strengthened in the face of demand for safe havens.
Unfortunately, the US economy, driven by debt and consumption, has slipped into recession, owing to deleveraging in the private sector and an increase in household savings.
To offset the negative impact of private-sector deleveraging on growth, the US government has pursued expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.
Now, with household debt on a knife edge after feverish government intervention, the fiscal position has deteriorated dramatically and the current account balance has deteriorated again.
The sustainability of public debt has replaced the sustainability of private debt as the biggest threat to financial stability, and the focus of the debate on the US current account has shifted from the sustainability of external debt to the impact of reducing the external deficit on growth and employment.
The dilemma facing US policymakers is to stimulate growth while reducing overall debt.
The most important way to achieve both objectives is to increase exports by strengthening US competitiveness.
But where will the increase in competitiveness come from?
Depreciation of the dollar could improve US competitiveness in the short term, but it is not a solution.
With investors now worried about capital losses on US government securities, given the rapid deterioration in the fiscal position, depreciation would make foreigners hesitant to finance America's budget deficit.
Without foreign financing, yields on US Treasuries will rise and the US economy will fall back into recession.
In the long run, America's growth pattern must undergo a structural shift away from dependence on debt and consumption to the American-vaunted capacity for creativity and innovation.
Only then will America improve its competitiveness sufficiently to allow the government to reduce both private and public debt to sustainable levels, while maintaining a respectable growth rate.
But neither improving competitiveness nor reducing total debt can be achieved overnight.
In the short term, the US current-account deficit will persist, regardless of which country runs bilateral surpluses.
Thus, China's continued reinvestment of its current-account surplus in US government securities is of paramount importance for US growth and financial stability.
Given that America benefits enormously from China's purchases of US government securities, it is difficult to understand why the US government and Congress complain so much about the bilateral current-account deficit.
It is also difficult to understand why China is so reluctant to reduce its bilateral surplus, given the meager returns on its massive holdings of US government securities and the continuing risk of large capital losses in the future.
The good news is that, following President Hu Jintao's recent visit to Washington, both America and China have taken positive steps to resolve their differences over the bilateral current account.
This bodes well for a more rational and constructive Sino-American dialogue on global imbalances, which would certainly benefit the global economy.
A baby step towards banking union
BRUSSELS - At the start of the financial crisis, banks were, in Charles Goodhart's words, "international in life, but national in death."
Back then (2008-2009), big international banks had to be bailed out by their home countries and governments if they got into trouble.
But the problem in Europe today is the opposite: banks are national in life, but European in death.
In Spain, for example, local savings banks (cajas) financed an outsize real estate boom.
When the boom broke, the losses threatened to exceed the capacity of the Spanish state, and the problem became European because it threatened the very survival of the euro.
The case of Spain is symptomatic of a larger problem.
National regulators always tend to minimize problems at home.
Their instinct (and bureaucratic interest) is to defend their countries as national champions abroad.
But their resistance to recognizing problems at home goes deeper.
Until recently, the Spanish authorities claimed that the problems in their country's real estate sector were temporary.
Recognizing the truth would have meant admitting that for years they had overlooked the building of an unsustainable construction boom that now threatens to bankrupt the entire country.
In the case of Ireland, the situation was not much different at first.
When the problems arose, the then finance minister initially claimed that the country would carry out the cheapest bank bailout ever.
Given the predictable tendency of national supervisors not to detect problems at home, it seemed only natural that the costs of resolving insolvent banks should also be borne at national level.
So it made sense that even in the eurozone, banking supervision remained largely national.
The recently created European Banking Authority has limited powers over national supervisors, whose day-to-day work is mainly guided by national considerations.
But reality has shown that this approach is untenable.
Problems may have their origins at the national level, but, because of monetary union, they quickly threaten the stability of the eurozone's entire banking system.
At their summit in June, European leaders finally recognized the need to rectify this situation and transfer responsibility for banking supervision in the eurozone to the European Central Bank.
Given that financial integration within the monetary union is particularly strong, it was natural to mandate the ECB.
Moreover, the ECB already has de facto responsibility for the stability of the eurozone banking system.
But until now, it has had to lend vast sums to banks without being able to assess their soundness, because all this information was in the hands of national authorities, which jealously guarded them and typically denied problems until it was too late.
The ECB's task should also help to stop the creeping disintegration process, which, although not publicly visible, is nonetheless very real.
Just ask one of the big international banking groups based in cash-strapped eurozone countries.
Take the case of a bank based in Italy but with an important subsidiary in Germany.
Of course, German operations generate a surplus of funds (because German savings far exceed investment on average).
The parent bank intends to use these funds to strengthen the Group's liquidity.
But the German supervisory authorities see Italy as at risk and therefore refuse any transfers of funds there.
The supervisory authority of the home country (Italy) has the opposite interest.
It wants the "internal capital market" to function as much as possible.
Here, too, it makes sense to use the ECB as a neutral arbiter of these conflicting interests.
But, while the ECB is responsible for banking supervision, it solves another problem: can national authorities still be held responsible for bailing out banks that no longer supervise them?
Economic (and political) logic requires that the eurozone soon also needs a common bank rescue fund.
Officially, this has not yet been confirmed.
But this is often the way in which European integration proceeds: an incomplete step in one area will later require further steps in related areas.
This incremental approach has worked well in the past; indeed, today's European Union has emerged from it.
But a financial crisis does not give policymakers the time they once had to explain to voters why one move required another.
A Berlin consensus?
HONG KONG < br > A recent trip to Berlin evoked memories of an earlier visit in the summer of 1967, when, as a poor student, I marvelled at the Wall that would divide and devastate an entire society for another two decades.
Berlin is alive and rejuvenated today, rebuilt through the hard work and sacrifices of the German people to unite the country, and a fitting setting for the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) conference that I attended.
The conference's theme was "Paradigm Lost." More than 300 economists, political scientists, system analysts, and ecologists came together to rethink economic and political theory in the face of the challenges and uncertainties posed by rising inequality, rising unemployment, global financial chaos, and climate change.
Almost everyone agreed that the old paradigm of neoclassical economics had been broken, but there was no agreement on what it could replace.
Nobel laureate Amartya Sen attributed the European crisis to four failures: political, economic, social, and intellectual.
The global financial crisis, which began in 2007 as a crisis of US subprime lending and expanded into a European sovereign-debt (and banking) crisis, has raised questions that we cannot answer because of over-specialization and fragmentation of knowledge.
And yet there is no denying that the world has become too complex for a simple, overarching theory to explain complex economic, technological, demographic, and environmental changes.
In particular, the rise of emerging markets has challenged the West's traditional deductive and inductive logic.
Deductive conclusions allow us to predict effects when we know the principles (the rule) and the cause.
Through inductive reasoning, if we know cause and effect, we can derive the principles.
Eastern thinking, by contrast, is deductive, shifting from pragmatism to guessing the next steps.
The abductive conclusion is pragmatic if you only want to look at the results, guess the rule, and determine the cause.
Like history, social science theory is written by the victors and shaped by the context and challenges of their time.
Free-market thinking evolved from Anglo-Saxon theorists (many of them from Scotland) who migrated and colonized areas, allowing happy people to assume that there were no limits to consumption.
Continental European thinking, responding to urbanization and the need for a social order, emphasized the institutional analysis of political economy.
Thus, the emergence of neoclassical economics in the nineteenth century was strongly influenced by Newtonian and Cartesian physics, which moved from qualitative analysis to quantification of human behavior by adopting rational behavior and excluding uncertainty.
This "predetermined equilibrium thinking" was reflected in the view that markets always corrected themselves, leading to political paralysis until the Great Depression, when John Maynard Keynes "argument for government intervention to address unemployment and output gaps gained traction.
In the 1970 "s, the neoclassical school of general equilibrium captured Keynesian economics through real-sector models that assumed that finance was a veil, blinding it to the destabilizing effects of financial markets.
Economists like Hyman Minsky, who tried to correct this, were largely ignored when Milton Friedman and others led the movement for free markets and minimal government intervention.
But then technology, demography, and globalization brought dramatic new challenges that the neoclassical approach could not foresee.
Even as advanced countries were overconsumed by leverage, four billion of the world's seven billion people began to switch to middle-income status, placing enormous demands on global resources and raising the question of environmental sustainability.
New thinking is needed to manage these massive and systemic changes, as well as the integration of giants like China and India into the modern world.
A change of mentality is needed not only in the West, but also in the East.
In 1987, the historian Ray Huang explained it for China:
As the world enters the modern age, most countries will have to reconstruct themselves, under internal and external pressure, by replacing agricultural experience-based governance with a new set of rules based on trade.
The process of renewal could affect the upper and lower strata, and it will inevitably be necessary to re-establish the institutional links between them.
Extensive destruction is often the order of the day and it can take decades to complete the work.
Using this macro-historical framework, we can view Japanese deflation, European debt, and even the Arab Spring as periods of systemic change within complex structures that interact in a new, multipolar global system.
We are witnessing simultaneous global convergence (narrowing income, wealth and knowledge disparities between countries) and local divergence (widening income, wealth and knowledge disparities within countries).
Adaptive systems struggle with order and creativity as they evolve.
As the philosopher Bertrand Russell presciently put it, "Security and justice require centralized state control, which must extend to the creation of a world government if it is to be effective.
On the contrary, progress requires the greatest possible scope for personal initiative, which is compatible with the social order.
A new wave of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter called "creative destruction" is underway: while central banks are struggling to maintain stability by flooding markets with liquidity, lending to businesses and households is shrinking.
We live in an age of simultaneous fear of inflation and deflation, of unprecedented prosperity amid growing inequality, and of technological progress and resource depletion.
Meanwhile, existing political systems promise good jobs, sound governance, a sustainable environment, and sacrifice-free social harmony - a self-interested free-rider's paradise that can only be sustained by sacrificing the natural environment and the well-being of future generations.
We cannot put off forever the pain of adjustment by printing money.
Sustainability can only be achieved if the have-nots are willing to sacrifice for the have-nots.
The Washington Consensus on free-market reforms for developing countries ended more than two decades ago.
The INET conference in Berlin showed the need for a new consensus that supports victims in the interest of unity.
A better and safer Europe
For many, myself included, NATO's enlargement to include the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania - once Soviet republics - is an unattainable dream.
When the idea was first floated about 10 years ago, the expansion into the Baltic was taken seriously by only a few people.
Until recently, Russia's staunch opposition to the idea was a serious obstacle, because it reinforced the impression that Russia regards its so-called "near abroad" as a zone of special interest and influence.
NATO enlargement makes it crystal clear that no country in the new Europe can be considered part of another country's "zone."
It assures the three small Baltic countries that the nightmare of occupation by their great neighbours (Hitler's Reich and Stalin's USSR), which they endured for half a century, will not be repeated.
By stopping all revanchist tendencies in Russia with regard to the Baltics, Europe will be safer, and Russia will be supported in its efforts to redefine itself as a nation-state, not an empire.
Enlargement will also create a better Europe, because enlargement expands the territory in which countries are committed to NATO's political values, including individual rights and the rights of minorities.
Fortunately, Russia now seems to understand the value of this political aspect of NATO enlargement.
Rightly so: NATO enlargement is not an "enlargement" that threatens Russia or other countries seeking democratic political reform.
On the contrary, enlargement deprives the large Russian-speaking populations that now live outside Russia, but within the borders of the former Soviet Union, of the worries - real or imagined - that surround them.
The civil rights of Russian minorities in the Baltics and elsewhere are now enshrined in law, not least because of NATO's demands.
NATO's civil-rights initiatives reflect the increasingly artisanal way in which Russia, Europe, and America are now settling their differences.
Indeed, NATO enlargement comes just days after Russia and the EU reached an agreement on the thorny issue of access to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.
This small piece of Russia with a million inhabitants, bordering the Baltic Sea, is sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania, two future EU members.
This could have led to a complicated situation in which Russians faced strict visa requirements when travelling between Kaliningrad and Russia.
An agreement has been reached between President Putin and the EU that significantly facilitates access without jeopardising the status of Lithuania and Poland within the EU regime.
This, in turn, once again created the kind of win-win situation that is so important for future EU-Russia relations.
When the enlargement of the EU to include Central and Eastern Europe is finally decided by the European Council in Copenhagen next month, the conclusion will be clear: Europe has become a much better and safer place to live, thanks to the decisions of NATO and the EU in the crucial autumn of 2002.
But that is no reason for complacency, because the really hard work is only just beginning: tackling all the internal practical and political problems that these enlargements will entail, as well as settling accounts with the countries in the waiting rooms of membership, Russia in particular.
Relations with Russia are crucial if Europe is to continue to improve the quality of life of its citizens and address security concerns.
The common threat of international terrorism must be addressed jointly.
We must convince each other that the fight against this common enemy must be waged with a keen eye in order to reconcile security needs with those of human and minority rights.
Kaliningrad could be a litmus test for these relations.
The first hurdle was cleared with the agreement on access to the enclave.
The next hurdle is to support Kalingrad's fight against disease and crime and to strengthen its economic and social structures.
This requires generosity from the EU and flexibility from Moscow.
In a broader context, this could lead to a strengthening of the EU's so-called Northern Dimension, where the objective is a free trade area covering all countries around the Baltic Sea.
Such a great project can be achieved if the political will is there and prevails.
Only a few years ago, EU and NATO enlargements were considered wild dreams.
But determination and political will have now made the dreams come true.
Now is the time to set new ambitious goals for Europe.
A Better Way to Reduce Nuclear Risks
When I served in President Jimmy Carter's State Department in 1977, I was sent to India to dissuade its leaders from developing an atomic bomb.
My hosts replied that they had to keep up with China.
I said that Pakistan would inevitably follow suit and the world would become less safe.
India promised not to export its weapons technology.
As far as we know, its leaders have kept their word.
But revelations about the nuclear smuggling network organized by A. Q. Khan, the father of the Pakistani bomb, confirm the danger I predicted at the time.
Some call Khan's network an attempt to spread an "Islamic bomb," but, given that North Korea was on the recipient list alongside Libya and Iran, it could better be called a corrupt bomb.
As events in Pakistan show, the proliferation of nuclear technology does not extend the stability that comes with mutual deterrence.
Rather, it increases the likelihood of corrupt leaks that could give terrorist groups access to nuclear weapons.
That makes everyone less safe.
Any pathological group of extremists could destroy New Delhi, Tokyo, Paris, or any city of their choosing.
Now the world's attention is on Iran, a recipient of Pakistani technology, which appears to be most eager to build its own nuclear arsenal.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran began enriching uranium at a pilot centrifuge facility last August and is currently building larger underground enrichment facilities.
Iran says its programs are for the peaceful production of nuclear energy, but inspectors have already found traces of highly enriched weapons-grade uranium.
Last October, the head of the IAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei, announced that Iran had accepted enhanced inspection procedures.
Iran also announced a temporary suspension of its enrichment program after visits by the foreign ministers of France, Britain and Germany.
Now it hints that it could resume enrichment, and recent press reports on imports from Pakistan suggest that Iran has not disclosed everything to the IAEA.
Iran claims that as a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty it has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes.
That's right, because the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was born with a loophole.
Even if a country agrees to extensive IAEA inspections, it can enrich legally enriched uranium (or reprocessed plutonium) under the guise of a peaceful energy program and then suddenly declare that circumstances have changed and withdraw from the treaty - with the ability to produce nuclear weapons in the short term.
If Iran did so, it would not only increase the dangers in an unstable region, but would probably set in motion a process of dismantling the global non-proliferation regime.
Iran may ask itself what right others have to demand that it renounce nuclear weapons.
The answer lies both in the fact that it promised not to do so when it signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty and in the consequences it would impose on others.
For these reasons, President Bush declared an Iranian nuclear weapon unacceptable.
America's unilateral options, however, are limited.
Not only is the US military busy trying to invade Iraq, but the way the US invaded Iraq - which turned out to be less nuclear-armed than Iran - has undermined America's credibility and made it difficult to recruit allies to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions.
Fortunately, there is a multilateral option and an existing precedent.
In the mid-1970s, many parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty planned to import and develop enrichment and reprocessing facilities.
Faced with the threat of the non-proliferation regime, countries as diverse as the Soviet Union, France, Germany, and Japan formed a "group of nuclear suppliers" that restricted exports of enrichment and reprocessing plants.
This closed part of the loophole in the Treaty without changing it.
Today, these countries should join forces to offer Iran (and others) a deal.
Countries that want to develop nuclear energy but not atomic bombs should receive international guarantees for the supply and disposal of spent fuel.
For example, Russia, which is helping Iran build a nuclear reactor at Bushehr, should offer Iran a guarantee of low-enriched uranium fuel and the reprocessing of the reactor's spent fuel by sending it back to Russia if Iran agrees to renounce enrichment and reprocessing.
The deal could then be endorsed by the UN Security Council.
The Council would declare that the further proliferation of nuclear weapons constitutes a threat to peace and that any country moving in this direction is subject to sanctions.
Such a resolution would also involve the carrot and stick of guaranteeing Iran access to the safe parts of the nuclear fuel cycle.
The pot could be sweetened by offers to ease existing sanctions and provide a security guarantee if Iran does not remain nuclear.
European foreign ministers have already expressed concern about Iran's nuclear programme.
Russia is signaling that it is ready to offer such fuel services.
It is time for the Security Council to try to internationalize the most dangerous parts of the nuclear fuel cycle.
It is not too late to learn the lessons of A. Q. Khan's misfortunes.
A Big Opportunity for Small Farmers
NEW YORK - The G-8 "s $20 billion initiative on smallholder agriculture, launched at the group's recent summit in L'Aquila, Italy, is a potentially historic breakthrough in the fight against hunger and extreme poverty.
If the new funds are managed seriously, food production in Africa will soar.
Indeed, the new initiative, along with others in the areas of health, education, and infrastructure, could be the biggest step yet toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the internationally agreed effort to reduce extreme poverty, disease, and hunger by half by 2015.
In 2002-2006, I led the United Nations Millennium Project, which aimed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, for then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
A cornerstone of the project was smallholder farmers, that is, peasant families in Africa, Latin America, and Asia who farmed farms of about one hectare or less.
These are some of the poorest households in the world and, ironically, some of the hungriest, even though they are food producers.
They are hungry because they lack the ability to buy high-yielding seeds, fertilizers, irrigators, and other tools needed to increase productivity.
As a result, their production is poor and insufficient for their livelihood.
Their poverty causes low agricultural productivity, and low agricultural productivity exacerbates their poverty.
It is a vicious circle known technically as a poverty trap.
The UN Millennium Project Hunger Task Force, led by two of the world's leading scientists, M. S. Swaminathan and Pedro Sanchez, explored how to break this vicious circle.
The Hunger Task Force found that Africa could substantially increase its food production by providing assistance to smallholder farmers in the form of agricultural inputs.
To this end, the Millennium Project recommended a significant increase in global funding.
Building on this work and related scientific evidence, Annan called in 2004 for an African Green Revolution based on an expanded partnership between Africa and donor countries.
Many of us, particularly the current UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, have worked hard to make this possible, with Ban repeatedly highlighting the particular emergency resulting from the global food, financial, and energy crises of the past two years.
The G-8 announcement reflects these years of effort and, of course, the boost to leadership from US President Barack Obama, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, World Bank President Robert Zoellick, European Commissioner Louis Michel, Euro MP Thijs Berman, and others.
What matters now is that these efforts work.
The lessons of history are clear.
Providing seed and fertilizer to smallholders at highly subsidized (or in some cases even free) prices will make a lasting difference.
Not only will food yields increase in the short term, but agricultural households will use their higher incomes and better health to accumulate all sorts of assets: cash stocks, soil nutrients, farm animals, and their children's health and education.
This increase in assets will, in turn, enable local credit markets such as microfinance to become operational.
Farmers will be able to buy inputs, either from their own money or by borrowing against their improved creditworthiness. Consensus has now been reached on the need to help small farmers, but obstacles remain.
Perhaps the main risk is that the "auxiliary bureaucracies" will now stumble over each other to try to get their hands on the $20 billion, so that much of it will be absorbed through meetings, expert consultations, overheads, reports, and other meetings.
Donor partnerships can become an expensive end in themselves and can only delay real action.
If donor governments really want results, they should take the money out of the hands of thirty or more separate aid bureaucracies and pool it in one or two places, the most logical being the World Bank in Washington and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in Rome.
One or both of these agencies would then have a multi-billion dollar account.
Governments in hunger-stricken regions, particularly in Africa, would then submit national action plans detailing how they would use donor funds to obtain high-yielding seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, agricultural tools, storage silos, and local advice for impoverished farmers.
An independent panel of experts would review national plans to verify their scientific and entrepreneurial coherence.
Assuming a plan goes through, the money to support it would be quickly disbursed.
Each national programme would then be monitored, audited and evaluated.
This approach is simple, efficient, accountable and scientifically sound.
Two major recent development success stories have used this approach: the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunization, which successfully immunizes young children, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, which supports national action plans to combat these deadly diseases.
Both have saved millions of lives over the last decade and paved the way for a new, more efficient and science-based method of development aid.
Not surprisingly, many UN agencies and aid agencies in rich countries are fighting this approach.
Too often, the fight is about territory, not the most effective way to speed up aid to the poor.
A black and white question
NEW YORK - On the afternoon of July 16, two men appeared to break into a fine home in an expensive area of Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Alarmed by a call, a police officer arrived at the scene.
He saw a black man standing in the house and asked him to come out.
The man refused.
Then he was told to identify himself.
The man, who still refused to get out, said he was a Harvard professor, showed his ID and warned the police officer not to mess with him.
He said something about the segregation of black men in America and asked the police officer, who was white, for his name and ID.
The policeman arrested the professor along with several colleagues for disorderly conduct.
We now know that the professor had broken into his own flat with the help of his chauffeur because the door was jammed.
What was unusual here was not the clumsiness of the policeman.
Most people in the US know that when you talk to the police, they get angry very quickly.
The fact that the man was black might or might not have led the police officer to handcuff him earlier than usual.
That, too, would not have been unusual.
What was special about this case was that Henry Louis < unk > Skip < unk > Gates is one of the most famous professors in the country, famous for his books, articles and numerous television appearances.
He is a grande, a doer and doer in the academic and media worlds, a friend of President Barack Obama. For this reason, he warned the policeman Sgt. James Crowley, a veteran of the Cambridge police, not to mess with him.
Class and race overlap in the US.
In this case, it is impossible to tell them apart.
Gates, deeply aware, indeed a specialist in the terrible history of race relations in his country, instinctively assumed that he was a victim of prejudice.
His words suggest he was just as aware that he was not getting the respect due to a distinguished Harvard professor and media star, telling his daughter in an interview published online: < unk > [Crowley] should have gone out there and said, < unk > I'm sorry, sir, good luck.
Did you love your [TV] show?
Unfortunately, Sgt. Crowley had never heard of Professor Gates. Crowley, a local whose brothers all serve in the police, a sports fan and an amateur basketball coach, does not move in the same social circles as Gates.
By coincidence, the charges were dropped, and that's where the case could have ended if President Obama, tired and frustrated after weeks of fighting over his health care law, had not intervened on behalf of his friend Gates and called the police "stupid."
Both he and Gates then spoke of learning from the incident.
Gates may even be planning a television documentary on racial profiling.
One thing you can learn if you didn't know this before is how close racial sensitivities are to the surface of US life, despite the election of a black president.
The complexity of black anger, white guilt, and black and white fear is so irritating that most Americans prefer not to talk about race at all.
One of Obama's great achievements is that the brilliance and subtlety of his rhetoric have made it a serious issue.
And there is still much to discuss: the grotesquely disproportionate number of black men in US prisons; the lack of educational opportunities in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods; the appalling health-care system; and the very real brutality with which police use against blacks who do not have the privilege of a Harvard ID card.
It is probably true that many white police officers, even if trained to avoid racial profiling, as Sgt. Crowley was, need to be convinced that a black man can be at home in one of the more noble homes of Cambridge or any other American city.
But is the Gates affair the right way to enter this discussion?
One could argue that it was. If not Professor Gates, then who?
It is precisely because he is a great man that he is able to draw national attention to a serious issue.
If the same thing had happened to an unknown man in Harlem or any other poor or predominantly black district, no one would ever have heard of it.
The fact that it happened to a professor at Cambridge makes everyone sit up and take notice.
However, there is a risk that this will have a detrimental effect on the necessary national debate on race.
By turning what should have been a relatively minor event into such a big issue, Gates could be accused of trivializing much worse cases of abuse.
In fact, we do not even know with certainty whether this was the case.
Crowley never mentioned Gates' skin color.
There was no talk of violence, only very raw nerves and hypersensitivity to suggestions of disrespect on the part of the professor and the policeman.
Outrage at a professor with whom one should not engage is not the best way to discuss the plight of countless poor, anonymous people, whom most of us too easily ignore.
A Bollywood bride for Sarkozy?
PARIS - French President Nicolas Sarkozy has run into trouble ever since he removed himself from his country's list of most popular bachelors by publicly admitting his affair with supermodel and pop musician Carla Bruni during a romantic trip to Euro Disney.
Its ratings have fallen below 50% for the first time.
Older French citizens do not find the public spectacle of their fallen head of state very amusing.
Abroad, Egyptian lawmakers were so concerned about the prospect of the French leader sharing a bed with his girlfriend that several expressed their disapproval on the floor of parliament.
India is also in a quandary over how to handle protocol during Sarkozy's upcoming visit to the subcontinent as a guest of honor at Republic Day celebrations on January 26.
Should the First Girlfriend have her own motorcade, as a First Lady would?
Meanwhile, the same right-wing Hindu groups that celebrate Valentine's Day as a decadent Western holiday warn that when Sarkozy arrives with his girlfriend in tow, he will take to the streets to welcome him.
The controversy threatens to overshadow a much-vaunted summit between two of the world's great democracies.
Given the lucrative deals with the major products that fuel the French economy - military hardware, nuclear power plants, and Airbus aircraft - France has a strong interest in a successful summit in India.
So could anger in India over the French president's very public love life be behind the rush to legally marry the couple while rumors of secret wedding ceremonies that have already been completed or are in the works are circulating?
The news in Sarkozy's favorite media Journal du Dimanche that the couple plans to marry sparked a wave of feverish speculation about when the happy event might occur.
The pair exchanged important signs of their mutual affection: he gave her a heart-shaped pink diamond ring from Dior and she gave him a Swiss watch.
It was "serious," the president admitted.
But he refused to divulge an exact date, even under direct questioning from reporters.
"You probably won't find out until it happens," he scoffed.
The couple are rumoured to have set February 8 or 9 for the wedding.
Others claim Sarkozy has already outsmarted the media by secretly marrying at the Elysee Palace, despite dodging wedding questions.
If true, Sarkozy has missed the romantic opportunity of a lifetime.
As the couple sizzled in front of cameras with Luxor and Petra as a backdrop, imagine how hot it could get at the most romantic place on earth, the Taj Mahal.
And, given the current fury over all Bollywood in France, a lavish Indian wedding would be appropriate.
Bruni's own path in life is similar to many Bollywood stars who have made the transition from model to actress.
A pretty brunette who sings is perfect for a Bollywood makeover.
As one of India's leading newspapers, the Indian Express, put it, "A girlfriend is not a wife or a spouse, so as not to confuse anyone."
Once they got married, all the protocol concerns about the French delegation would simply disappear.
Despite the sometimes downright pornographic contortions of Bollywood starlets on screen, India is still a deeply conservative society.
Divorce is an abomination.
(Sarkozy is now divorced twice.)
And while mistresses abound in the privileged classes, they do not publicly strut past their power partners.
Kissing and fondling in public, even by spouses, is taboo.
In this respect, India resembles France, with which Sarkozy wants to achieve a clean break, rather than the current one.
Most Indians, it seems to many French, would prefer not to discard Sarkozy's "hypocrisy" from his predecessors (read: former French President François Mitterrand, who had a child with his mistress, whom the public knew nothing about until the man's funeral).
Sarkozy, of all people, should know that much of the office's appeal stems from pomp and circumstance.
Statecraft is an area where appearances are deceptive.
When Sarkozy, who otherwise has such fine-tuned media instincts, protests that he is no different from any other man, he comes dangerously close to confusing office and personality.
Most French people could only dream of an exotic wedding in India.
Sarkozy could realize that dream.
If he really is as head over heels in love with Bruni as he claims and plans to marry her soon, why not use his upcoming trip to India to make this wedding an unforgettable one?
He could meet his bride, who sits majestically on the caparison of an elaborately decorated elephant, and she would look ravishing wrapped in Indian plaster and adorned.
The "bling-bling" president, as Sarkozy was christened, can wear all the gold he wants and add even more diamonds to his bride.
Cameras would roll, Indians would smile, and France would experience a Bollywood spectacle beyond its wildest dreams.
A bomb in every reactor
BERLIN - Twenty-five years after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and the ongoing disaster at Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant, it must hopefully be made clear once and for all that the supposed blessings of the nuclear age are mere illusions: nuclear power is neither clean, safe, nor cheap.
In fact, the opposite is true: nuclear power carries three major unresolved risks: plant safety, nuclear waste, and, most ominously, the risk of military proliferation.
Furthermore, the alternatives to nuclear energy and fossil fuels are well known and technically much more advanced and sustainable.
Taking on nuclear risks is not a necessity, but a conscious political choice.
Fossil fuels and nuclear energy are among the technological utopias of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, based on a belief in the innocence of the technologically feasible and on the fact that only a minority of the world's population at the time, mostly in the West, benefited from technological progress.
By contrast, the twenty-first century will be shaped by the recognition that the global ecosystem and its resources, essential to human survival, are finite, and that this implies a lasting responsibility to preserve what we have.
Corresponding to this imperative means both an enormous technological challenge and an opportunity to redefine the meaning of modernity.
The energy future of nine billion people, as the world's population will have in the middle of the century, lies not in fossil fuels or nuclear energy, but in renewable energy sources and dramatic improvements in energy efficiency.
We already know that.
Why, then, are the most advanced countries, in particular, risking a mega-disaster by trying to extract energy from radioactive fission?
Ultimately, the answer lies not in any civilian use of nuclear energy, but primarily in its military applications.
The energy derived from the fission of uranium and plutonium atoms was originally used for the ultimate weapon, the atomic bomb.
Being a nuclear power offers sovereign states protection and prestige.
Even today, the bomb divides the world into two classes: the few states that have it and the many that do not.
The old Cold War world order was based on the nuclear arms race between the two superpowers, the US and the Soviet Union.
In order to prevent others from becoming nuclear powers that would have multiplied and spread the risk of nuclear confrontation, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was formulated in the 1960 "s. To this day, it governs relations between the nuclear powers and the rest of the world, forcing the haves to renounce nuclear weapons and disarmament.
Of course, the NPT has been repeatedly violated or circumvented by states that have never signed it.
To date, there is therefore a risk that the number of nuclear powers will increase, especially in view of the small and medium-sized powers that hope to improve their prestige and position in regional conflicts.
Iran is the latest example of this.
The nuclearization of these not-always-stable states threatens to make the regional conflicts of the twenty-first century much more dangerous, and will also significantly increase the risk that nuclear weapons will eventually end up in the hands of terrorists.
Despite the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, a clear separation between civilian and military uses of nuclear energy has not always worked or worked, because the provisions of the Non-Proliferation Treaty allow all signatory states to develop and use "under international supervision" all components of the nuclear fuel cycle for civilian purposes.
From here, only a few small technical steps and the decision of policymakers are needed to become a nuclear power.
It is this political power, rather than the demands of energy policy, that makes phasing out nuclear energy so difficult.
As a rule, the path to nuclear weapons status always begins with so-called "civilian" nuclear programs.
Iran's alleged "civilian" nuclear ambitions, for example, have led to a large number of such "civilian" programs in neighboring countries.
Honni soit qui mal y pense!
And, of course, the nuclear powers "reactions to the Fukushima disaster are being closely monitored and analyzed by the so-called" secret emerging economies. "
So how will the world, especially the major nuclear powers, react to the Fukushima disaster?
Will the tide really turn and push the world toward nuclear disarmament and a nuclear weapons-free future?
Or are we witnessing attempts to downplay the disaster and get back to business as quickly as possible?
Fukushima has presented the world with a far-reaching, fundamental choice.
It was Japan, the high-tech country par excellence (not the later Soviet Union), that was unable to take adequate precautions to avert disaster in four reactor blocks.
What will a future risk assessment look like when much less organized and developed countries, "with active support from the nuclear powers," begin to acquire civilian nuclear capacities?
Any decision to carry on as before would send an unequivocal message to the secretive emerging economies that secretly seek nuclear weapons: despite lofty rhetoric and wordy documents, the nuclear powers lack the political will to change course.
However, if they were to abandon nuclear energy, their epochal change of heart would be a groundbreaking contribution to global nuclear security and thus to the fight against nuclear proliferation.
A reborn CAP
WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS - The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), born in 1957, is now more than 50 years old, and the European Commission is proposing a so-called health check for its middle-aged child.
But superficial repairs do not meet the future needs of the European Union.
The CAP must be reborn.
Work on its renewal is now due to begin, with the completed project due to be completed in 2013.
But a much deeper rethink is needed.
The original aim of the CAP was to provide a safe source of food for the six original Member States of the Union that imported food and sought a degree of self-sufficiency.
Good, healthy and cheap food should be accessible to all citizens.
Improved agricultural productivity would benefit rural areas and give farmers a comparable share of the Union's growing prosperity.
Instruments have been developed to achieve these objectives and food security has been achieved.
The CAP was quickly seen as a jewel in the crown of the European project.
With the development and enlargement of the EU, food systems have become more complex and include production, processing, supply chain organisation, wholesale and retail, all of which include new issues such as health and the environment.
Land use will also come under more serious scrutiny.
A 1991 study by the Dutch Science Council on Government Policy, Ground for Choices, showed that the EU's food supply could be met with 50% less acreage, 80% less pesticides and 50% less costs.
Pollution would be reduced by 70% by reducing nitrates in surface water and greenhouse gases.
These figures applied to an EU of 15 countries, so the possibilities are even greater with the current 27 members.
A Dutch analysis of land use has shown that significant progress in food production could be made by using the best technical and environmental means on the best available land.
Not surprisingly, the number of farmers needed has fallen significantly.
From the point of view of food security and the wealth of rural areas, there is now an urgent need to review the main instruments of the CAP in order to introduce a new political formula.
Perverse subsidies must be abolished and new subsidies that favour products such as biofuels reconsidered.
The status quo clearly needs to be changed: rural policy in the EU is too often reduced to income guarantees for farmers.
But that attitude undermines change.
Competition must be encouraged, as more rural entrepreneurship will strengthen the farming community with fewer farmers but better farms.
A simplified CAP would promote cleaner, more productive and more efficient agriculture.
A side-effect for the EU's standing in the world could be that the stalled Doha negotiations of the World Trade Organisation could be resumed as soon as farmers in developing countries are assured of a fair agreement from Europe, and the role of the CAP as the engine of political and social integration in Europe could be restored as soon as a renewed policy is in place.
However, renewal of this kind cannot be left to global market forces, as the results may not necessarily benefit European agriculture and society.
If the market misbehaves, farmers could fall into poverty, leading to the neglect of large parts of Europe.
This is a sufficiently great danger that politicians will have to think seriously about when they reform the CAP on the basis of the following five pillars.
1.
The EU needs a knowledge and innovation policy that strengthens the competitiveness of European agriculture.
Such a policy was successful in the Netherlands and contributed significantly to the development and power of the country's agricultural industry.
Ten of the 21 branches of the Dutch agricultural industry, including garden seeds, ornamental plants, seed potatoes and veal, are among the top contributors to the country's economy and trade balance.
In the EU as a whole, a policy focused on research programmes to promote scientific excellence and greater coherence in the European knowledge system would significantly strengthen the competitiveness of agriculture and contribute to food security and sustainable development.
2.
Europe also needs a restructuring policy for land use.
Many structural improvement programmes have been financed at European level, but agricultural production and land use are not included.
The development of a main agricultural structure would complement the main European ecological structure.
Reforestation and the repair of natural ecosystems should also be part of a land-use policy.
3rd.
A policy for European food systems would deal with production, processing, distribution, logistics and retail in combination.
Consumption patterns and preferences are an integral part of such systems.
Preliminary studies by the European Science Foundation's "Forward Look on European Food Systems" could prove useful in developing an EU-wide policy.
4th
Urban agriculture in a rapidly urbanizing world can provide high-quality products on small areas.
It provides a response to the growing demand for healthy foods with minimal environmental side effects.

Boycott Against Reason
"It could happen here" is the abbreviation often used for a host of alarming hypothetical scenarios. "How could it happen here?" was the question that was asked more accurately in Britain recently, when its universities witnessed the unfolding of an all-too-real and bewildering action.
In early June, the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE), Britain's largest academic union with 67,000 members, passed a motion to cut ties with all Israeli professors and colleges unless they publicly distance themselves from the continuation of Israeli apartheid policies.
The motion was subsequently withdrawn, but the fact that it was tabled at all is astonishing enough.
Indeed, the union's call for a full-scale boycott violated its most fundamental values: the principle of academic freedom, openness and exchange, the protection of research from government policies, and the fundamental right to freedom of expression.
The motion implicitly adopted the standard of collective punishment and a distinctly McCarthyist tone, demanding a kind of "oath of disloyalty" from Israeli academics.
What prompted scholars, who are supposed to be the guardians of democratic freedoms, to adopt measures so reminiscent of fascist and Stalinist tactics?
Unfortunately, the NATFHE efforts are part of a larger phenomenon.
In 2005, the Association of University Teachers (AUT) called for a more limited boycott and singled out the universities of Bar Ilan and Haifa for negligence.
Earlier, a petition signed by some 80 prominent British intellectuals and some from other European countries called for an end to EU funding of Israeli cultural projects and institutions.
These campaigns, supported by Palestinian groups and non-governmental organisations, have been accompanied by individual acts of professional ostracism, and there is already an informal boycott of Israeli scholars, publications and cultural projects in some European circles.
Such developments indicate an advanced and deeply disturbing trend whereby certain segments of the European intelligentsia are prepared to violate their own beliefs in order to target a state for a unique stigma, and in which insidious and sometimes illegal forms of discrimination against its citizens are increasingly considered acceptable.
In a certain ideological mindset, Israel is perceived not as a political entity receptive to prevailing standards of judgment, but as an almost allegorical force, as the symbolic center and source of the ills and sufferings of the globe.
Of course, Israel is guilty of both bad politics and political sins.
The occupation of Palestinian territories has had terrible consequences and it must end.
But in today's highly charged climate, the Middle East has become a kind of ideological projection screen, a magnet for tendencies toward demonization and idealization.
In the supposedly radical interpretation, the relationship between Israel and the Palestinians is rarely seen as a conflict between two groups with sometimes tragically opposing interests.
Rather, the persistent complexity of the situation boils down to a fierce struggle between absolute power and absolute powerlessness, the archetypal oppressor and archetypal oppressed.
The rhetoric used against Israel is becoming increasingly extreme and conducive to hatred.
Phrases like "apartheid state" and "Zionism is racism," which were unthinkable in liberal discourse only a few years ago, have become routine.
At the same time, Palestinians are becoming objects of romanticized identification: one of the leaders of the NAFTHE proposal was seen draped in a Palestinian flag and unknowingly condescending before a meeting.
They are regarded as the ultimate pure cause, the completely innocent "other," who is not involved in its fate and who apparently lacks the capacity or choice to act politically.
The possibility that the Palestinians are capable of making conscious decisions, that they have pursued policies that may have contributed to the current situation, or that they have exercised their own forms of power and violence, is never acknowledged in this context.
Hamas was not mentioned in any of the motions put forward by the university unions.
This is the Manichaeism of the left, and like the Manichaeism of the political right, it can distort reality to the point of detaching itself from it.
Of course, the boycott effort ignored basic facts.
Unless British academics are ill-informed, they know that Israel is far from an apartheid state, but has a large proportion of Arab citizens; that Israeli universities are well integrated, sometimes with a significant number of Arab students and an admittedly small and insufficiently representative number of Arab faculties; that many universities promote cooperation projects with Palestinian and Arab counterparts; that they are often sites of dissent against government policies; and that this dissent, even in a radical form, is tolerated.
Advocates of discriminatory measures often accuse their opponents of suppressing legitimate criticism of Israel.
This argument is both disingenuous and dishonest.
Many of the boycotts and critics are also critical of Israel.
Credible criticism must, however, be based on evidence and generally valid evaluation criteria.
If the British trade unions wanted to be ethically consistent, they should apply the same policies to universities in the many countries where human rights are brutally violated and freedom of expression suppressed.
Some see this hostility to Israel as a camouflage of old-fashioned anti-Semitism.
It is always risky to speculate on hidden motives; nevertheless, the systematic denigration of Israeli society and culture undoubtedly fosters the feeling that anti-Semitism is also a permissible prejudice.
It is always easier to regard a group or nation as a malignant "other" when this impulse is fed by an old and still strong prejudice.
There is a deeper problem at stake.
Democratic societies depend not only on the basic principle of freedom of speech, but also on the nature of political thinking and conversations between different constituencies.
When the supposedly most enlightened and liberal of these constituencies resort to illiberal discourses and intolerant policies, the tendencies toward bigotry and ideological irrationality intensify.
The actions of the British academic unions have Israel as an obvious target.
But its main effect could be an erosion of rational debate and civil behavior, without which democracy is powerless against the forces of polarization and extremism.
A Breakthrough Against Hunger
NEW YORK - Today's global hunger crisis is unprecedented and requires urgent action.
Nearly a billion people are trapped in chronic hunger, perhaps 100 million more than two years ago.
Spain is leading the world in the fight against hunger by inviting world leaders to Madrid at the end of January to turn words into deeds.
Led by Spain and partnered by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, several donor governments are proposing to pool their financial resources so that the world's poorest farmers can grow more food and escape poverty.
The benefits of some donor assistance can be remarkable.
Smallholder farmers in Africa, Haiti, and other impoverished regions are currently planting their crops without the benefit of high-yielding seeds and fertilizers.
The result is a cereal yield (e.g. maize) that is about one third below what could be achieved with better inputs.
African farmers produce about one ton of grain per hectare, compared to more than four tons per hectare in China, where farmers use a lot of fertilizer.
African farmers know that they need fertilizer; they simply cannot afford it.
With the help of donors, they can.
These farmers will not only feed their families, but will also be able to start generating market incomes and saving for the future.
By accumulating savings over a few years, farmers eventually become creditworthy or have enough money to buy basic necessities themselves.
There is now broad agreement on the need to increase donor financing for smallholder farmers (those with two hectares or less of land or impoverished shepherds), which is particularly urgent in Africa.
The UN Secretary-General led a steering group last year that found that African agriculture needs about $8 billion a year in donor funding - about four times the current total - with a focus on improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems, and enlargement training.
In addition to direct aid to small farms, donors should provide more support for the research and development needed to identify new high-yielding seed varieties, especially for breeding crops that can withstand temporary floods, excess nitrogen, salty soils, plant pests and other challenges to sustainable food production.
Helping the poor with today's technologies while investing in improved technologies in the future is the optimal division of labor.
This investment is paying off miraculously: research centers like the International Rice Research Institute and the International Center for the Improvement of Corn and Wheat are delivering high-yielding seeds and innovative cultivation strategies that together triggered the Green Revolution in Asia.
These centers are not household names, but they deserve it.
Their scientific breakthroughs have helped feed the world, and we will need more of them.
Dozens of low-income and food-deficit countries, perhaps as many as 40-50, have developed urgent programmes to increase food production by small farms, but are currently being held back by the lack of donor funds.
These countries have turned to the World Bank for funding, and the Bank made a valiant effort in 2008 to help through its new Global Food Crisis Response Programme (GFCRP).
But the Bank does not yet have sufficient funds to meet these countries "urgent needs, and has had to ration aid to a small fraction of the flows that could be used effectively and reliably.
Hundreds of millions of people, meanwhile, remain trapped in a famine trap.
Many individual donor countries have stated that they are now ready to increase their financial support for smallholder agriculture, but are looking for appropriate mechanisms to do so.
The current support structures are inadequate.
The more than 20 bilateral and multilateral donor organisations for agriculture are highly fragmented and not sufficiently large individually or collectively.
Despite the dedicated efforts of many experts, the response to the hunger crisis remains woefully inadequate.
The planting season of 2008 came and went with far too little additional aid for impoverished smallholders.
African countries search endlessly and largely unsuccessfully for the small amounts needed to buy fertilizer and improved seeds.
My colleagues and I, who are members of an advisory committee on the Spanish initiative, have recommended that donors pool their funds in a single international account, which we call the Financial Coordination Mechanism (FCM).
These pooled resources would allow farmers in poor countries to obtain the fertilizer, improved seed varieties, and small irrigation systems they urgently need.
Poor countries would receive rapid and predictable financing for agricultural inputs from a single account, not from dozens of different and fragmented donors.
Pooling financial resources into a single donor could keep aid programs and administrative costs low, ensure the availability of aid flows, and eliminate the need for poor countries to negotiate 25 times to receive aid.
The time for business as usual is over.
Donors have promised to double aid to Africa by 2010, but they are still a long way off.
In fact, over the last 20 years, they have actually reduced aid for agricultural programmes and are only now reversing course.
Meanwhile, a billion people are starving every day.
We need a breakthrough that is demonstrable, public, clear and convincing, that can mobilise the hearts and minds of the public and that can be successful.
History can be made in Madrid at the end of January when the world's richest and poorest countries come together to find solutions to the global hunger crisis.
The lives of the billion poorest depend on it.
A Breakthrough Opportunity for Global Health
NEW YORK - Millions of people die each year from preventable and treatable diseases, especially in poor countries.
In many cases, life-saving drugs can be mass-produced cheaply, but are sold at prices that block access for those who need them.
And many die simply because there are no cures or vaccines, because so little of the world's valuable research talent and limited resources is spent on fighting the diseases of the poor.
This state of affairs is a failure of the economy and the law, which urgently needs to be rectified.
The good news is that there are now opportunities for change, most promising through international efforts led by the World Health Organization, which would begin to repair the broken intellectual property system that impedes the development and availability of cheap medicines.
Two major problems are limiting the availability of medicines today.
One of them is that they are very expensive; or, more precisely, that the price charged for them is very high, even though the cost of production is only a fraction of that amount.
Second, drug development is geared to maximizing profits, not social benefits, which distorts efforts to develop medicines that are essential to people's well-being.
Because the poor have so little money to spend, pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to research the diseases that affect them under current conditions.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Pharmaceutical companies argue that high prices are necessary to fund research and development.
But in the United States, the government funds most health-related R & D directly, through public support (the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation), and indirectly through public purchases of drugs, both under Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Even the part that is not financed by the government is not a conventional market; most people who buy prescription drugs are insured.
The state funds health-care research because improved drugs are a public good.
The resulting knowledge benefits everyone by stopping epidemics and limiting the economic and human toll of widespread diseases.
Efficiency requires disseminating research as widely as possible as soon as it becomes available.
Thomas Jefferson likened knowledge to candles: if one is accustomed to lighting another, it does not diminish the light of the first.
On the contrary, everything is getting brighter.
But drug prices are still exorbitant in America and most of the world, and the dissemination of knowledge is strictly limited.
This is because we have created a patent system that gives innovators a temporary monopoly over what they create, and encourages them to hoard their knowledge so that they do not help a competitor.
Although this system provides incentives for certain types of research by making innovation profitable, it allows pharmaceutical companies to push up prices, and the incentives do not necessarily correspond to societal returns.
In the healthcare sector, it may be more profitable to focus on research into a "me-too" drug than on developing a treatment that makes a real difference.
The patent system can even have a detrimental effect on innovation, because although the most important input for any research is previous ideas, the patent system promotes secrecy.
One solution to both high prices and misguided research is to replace the current model with a government-supported price fund.
A pricing system rewards innovators for new knowledge, but they do not retain a monopoly on its use.
In this way, the power of competitive markets can ensure that a medicine is available after development at the lowest possible price and not at an excessive monopoly price.
Fortunately, some US lawmakers are showing a strong interest in this approach.
The Prize Fund for HIV / AIDS Act, a congressional bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, is just such an initiative.
His bill also contains an important provision aimed at promoting open-source research, which would shift the current research model from secrecy to exchange.
But globally, our innovation system needs much bigger changes.
The WHO's efforts to promote comprehensive reforms at international level are crucial.
This spring, the WHO issued a report recommending solutions similar to those in the US Senate bill, but at a global level.
Importantly, the report, "Research and Development to Meet Health Needs in Developing Countries," recommends a comprehensive approach that includes mandatory government funding for research into health needs in developing countries, international coordination of health-care priorities and implementation, and a global observatory that monitors where needs are greatest.
At the end of May, the international community has a chance to begin implementing these ideas at the WHO's World Health Assembly - a moment of hope for global public health.
Reform of our innovation system is not just a matter of economics, but in many cases a matter of life and death.
It is therefore essential to decouple incentives for research and development from pharmaceutical prices and to encourage a greater exchange of scientific knowledge.
For America, the Sanders Act represents an important step forward.
For the world, the WHO's recommendations represent a unique opportunity to address long-standing and egregious health-care inequalities and, more broadly, to set a model for governance of global public goods that is appropriate for an era of globalization.
A centerless euro is unsustainable
CAMBRIDGE - With youth unemployment at nearly 50% in eurozone countries like Spain and Greece, is a generation sacrificed to a single currency that comprises a group of countries too diverse to be sustainable?
If so, does enlargement of the euro really serve Europe's obvious goal of maximizing economic integration without necessarily achieving full political union?
The good news is that economic research has a lot to say about whether Europe should have a single currency.
The bad news is that it is becoming increasingly clear that monetary areas, at least for large countries, will be highly unstable unless they follow national borders.
At the very least, monetary unions require a confederation with far more centralized power over taxes and other policies than European leaders envision for the eurozone.
What about Nobel laureate Robert Mundell's famous 1961 assumption that national and monetary boundaries need not significantly overlap?
In his provocative paper in the American Economic Review, "A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas," Mundell argued that the region could afford to abandon the exchange-rate adjustment mechanism as long as workers within a currency region could migrate to where the jobs were.
He credited another (future) Nobel laureate, James Meade, for recognizing the importance of labor mobility in previous work, but criticized Meade for interpreting the idea too strictly, especially in the context of nascent European integration.
Mundell did not highlight financial crises, but labor mobility is probably more important now than ever.
Not surprisingly, workers are leaving the crisis-hit eurozone countries, but not necessarily to the stronger north.
Instead, Portuguese workers are fleeing to booming former colonies like Brazil and Macau.
Irish workers flock to Canada, Australia and the United States. Spanish workers flock to Romania, which until recently was an important source of agricultural labor in Spain.
If mobility within the eurozone were anywhere near Mundell's ideal, we would not have 25% unemployment in Spain today, while unemployment in Germany is below 7%.
Subsequent authors recognized that there are other essential criteria for a successful monetary union that are difficult to achieve without deep political integration.
Peter Kenen argued in the late 1960 "s that a currency union without exchange-rate fluctuations as a shock absorber required fiscal transfers of risk-sharing.
For a normal country, the national income tax system is an enormous automatic stabiliser between regions.
When oil prices rise in the US, incomes rise in Texas and Montana, which means that these states then contribute more tax revenue to the federal budget, thereby helping the rest of the country. Europe, of course, does not have a significant centralized tax authority, so this important automatic stabilizer is essentially missing.
Some European scholars have tried to argue that there is no need for US-style fiscal transfers, since in theory any desired degree of risk-sharing can be achieved through financial markets.
This claim was completely misguided.
Financial markets can be fragile, and they offer few opportunities to share risks related to labor income, which accounts for the largest share of income in any advanced economy.
Kenen focused on short-term transfers to compensate for cyclical bumps.
But, in a monetary union with huge differences in income and development levels, the short-term can be very long.
Many Germans today rightly feel that any system of fiscal transfers will turn into a permanent feeding tube, much as northern Italy propped up southern Italy in the last century.
Indeed, more than 20 years later, West Germans still do not see an end to the accounts of German unity.
Later, Maurice Obstfeld pointed out that, in addition to fiscal transfers, a monetary union needs clearly defined rules for the lender of last resort.
Otherwise, bank runs and debt panics will proliferate.
Obstfeld had in mind a rescue mechanism for banks, but it is now abundantly clear that a lender of last resort and a bankruptcy mechanism for states and municipalities are also needed.
A corollary of the criteria set by Kenen and Obstfeld, and even Mundell's criterion of labor mobility, is that monetary unions cannot survive without political legitimacy, most likely involving regional elections.
European leaders cannot carry out indefinite transfers between countries without a coherent European policy framework.
Today, European leaders often complain that the eurozone would be doing well without the US financial crisis.
Maybe they're right.
But any financial system must be able to withstand shocks, even large ones.
Europe may not be an optimal currency area in any way.
But, without further deep political and economic integration, which may not include all current eurozone members, the euro may not even make it to the end of this decade.
A Chinese champion for peace and freedom
PRAGUE - On Christmas Day last year, one of China's best-known human rights activists, writer and university professor Liu Xiaobo, was sentenced to 11 years in prison. Liu is one of the main authors of Charter 08, a petition inspired by Czechoslovakia's Charter 77, which calls on the Chinese government to abide by its own laws and constitution and calls for the open election of officials, freedom of religion and expression, and the abolition of laws on subversion.
For his courage and clear thinking about China's future, Liu deserves the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. There are two reasons why we believe Liu would be a worthy recipient of this prestigious award.
First and foremost, it follows in the tradition of Nobel Peace Prize winners who have been recognized for their contribution to the struggle for human rights. Nobel laureates such as Martin Luther King, Lech Walesa, and Aung San Suu Kyi are just some of the many examples that the Nobel Committee has recognized in recent years.
We are convinced that the concepts put on paper by Liu and his colleagues in December 2008 are both universal and timeless; these ideals - respect for human rights and human dignity and the responsibility of citizens to ensure that their governments respect these rights - represent humanity's highest goals.
If the Nobel Committee decides to recognize Liu's courage and sacrifice in formulating these ideals, it would not only draw global attention to the injustice of Liu's 11-year sentence, but also help to strengthen within China the universal and humanist values for which Liu has spent much of his life fighting.
The second reason why Liu deserves the Nobel Peace Prize is consistent with Alfred Nobel's original intention to award the prize: by championing human rights, political reform, and democratization in China, Liu has made a significant contribution to the values of peace and brotherhood among nations that Nobel had in mind when he created the prize more than a century ago.
But it enables a broad and rigorous public debate on key foreign and domestic policy issues. This active and searching conversation, which is the hallmark of a democratic polity, is the best hope for better decisions by governments at home and abroad.
Liu's strong commitment to democracy in China is primarily for the benefit of the Chinese people, but his courage and example could help hasten the dawn of a day in which China's participation in international affairs will be supported by the expertise and oversight of civil-society groups, independent media, and engaged citizens who can express their views at the ballot box.
For these two reasons above all, we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. By awarding Liu one of the highest honors in the world, the Committee would once again signal the importance of human rights and democracy on the one hand, and world peace and international solidarity on the other.
Liu < unk > s harsh prison sentence was intended as an exemplary measure, a stern warning to all other Chinese who want to follow his path. We are convinced that there are moments when exemplary civic engagement, such as Liu < unk > s, requires an exemplary response.
A climate agreement is not enough
AMSTERDAM - During the COP15 climate summit in Copenhagen, world leaders are negotiating the planet's future.
All the indications are that they are unlikely to sign a global climate treaty.
The views of the different countries and of the various industrial and political power blocs diverge too much.
Politicians, officials, and other participants at the Copenhagen Summit are mainly bombarding each other with figures: figures on how much different countries should reduce their CO2 emissions, how much money they should provide in the coming years, the exact nature of their responsibilities, how much temperature rise the earth can tolerate, and how long we can wait.
These are all very important questions.
But the sheer numbers are simply not enough.
We need a different approach to the problem of climate change.
The climate problem can only be solved on the basis of common, deeply felt ethical principles.
Humanity has reached a critical point in the history of the earth where peoples and nations must recognize their solidarity with each other and with the earth and begin to act accordingly.
Just as world leaders adopted the United Nations Millennium Declaration in September 2000, embracing the resulting Millennium Development Goals, today's climate negotiators will have to commit to establishing a foundation of common fundamental ethical principles.
Such a basis is not hard to find.
Its inspiration may be the Earth Charter, launched in 2000 and initiated by former USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev, among others, and Wangari Mathaai, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004 for her efforts in the Green Belt, a pan-African tree-planting initiative.
The climate problem does not stop at borders.
Over the next few decades, a low-lying country like the Netherlands will have to invest billions of euros to intensify its age-old fight against rising water.
But in many other countries the water is already spilling over the dikes, both literally and figuratively.
Climate change mainly affects those countries that lack the money to take adequate action against rising sea levels, persistent droughts, or devastating storms, even though they had nothing to do with the main cause of these problems, industrialization in industrialized countries.
In addition to the necessary, often infrastructural adjustments to survive the effects of climate change, enormous efforts are needed to prevent worse.
Major investments in afforestation, agriculture and energy supply are needed.
The role of women should be central to the development of solutions.
Women are often the first people to have to deal with the problem of access to natural resources, and they are able to play an important role as pioneers in finding solutions to climate change and how humanity should adapt to it.
In the short term, the world should become a sustainable global society with low carbon emitters.
This is a mission for all of humanity, in which patriotic feelings and thinking have no place in power blocs.
The quest for a sustainable global society with low CO2 emissions will require enormous efforts.
It is precisely for this reason that a broad ethical basis is needed.
This would lead the negotiating parties to seek not only solutions to one part of the problem, but, first and foremost, a comprehensive solution to the whole problem.
The issue of climate change is too important to be left to politicians.
In Copenhagen, therefore, it is imperative that not only nation states, but also business and citizens unite their efforts to save the planet's climate.
This is not just a scientific necessity, but an ethical imperative.
Chemistry like clockwork
OXFORD < br > In Anthony Burgess's novella (and Stanley Kubrick's film) A Clockwork Orange, Alex, an unrepentant psychopath, has his eyes wide open and is forced to watch violent images.
Like Pavlov's dog, Alex is programmed to react with nausea to violence and sex.
This scene remains shocking, but, like most sci-fi films, it has aged.
The behavioral psychology on which it was based is long gone, and the fear that science will be used to make people morally better, let alone force them, sounds old-fashioned today.
Science fiction ages quickly, but has a long afterlife.
Over the past decade, an army of psychologists, neuroscientists, and evolutionary biologists has been busy uncovering the neural clockwork that underlies human morality.
They have begun to trace the evolutionary origins of pro-social sensations such as empathy, and have begun to uncover the genes that lead some individuals to senseless violence and others to altruistic acts, and the pathways in our brains that shape our ethical choices.
And understanding how something works also means finding ways to change and even control it.
In fact, scientists have identified not only some of the brain pathways that influence our ethical decisions, but also chemical substances that modulate this neural activity.
A recent study has shown that the antidepressant citalopram can alter individuals "responses to hypothetical moral dilemma scenarios.
People who were given the drug were less willing to sacrifice one individual to save the lives of several others.
Another set of studies has shown that the hormone oxytocin, when administered via nasal spray, increases trusting and cooperative behavior within social groups, but also reduces cooperation with people perceived as outsiders.
Neuroscientists have even targeted areas of people's brains to influence their moral judgments in surprising ways - for example, to make it easier for them to lie.
Of course, no one develops a "moral pill" that turns us into saints.
But research is advancing rapidly, and it is almost certain that it will propose new ways to reshape our moral intuitions, feelings, and motivations.
Should we use our growing scientific understanding of the foundations of human morality to try to make people morally better?
A Clockwork Orange has been accused of glorifying violence, and some of its scenes are still hard to see.
But, as Burgess himself argued, the novella has an almost Christian message: what makes us human is our freedom to choose good and evil, and that society forces individuals into submissive conformity is as vile as the sadism of psychopaths like Alex, and perhaps even worse.
I suspect that many will agree.
They will agree that our ability to distinguish right from wrong is something valuable that we should protect, not a broken clock that scientists should fix.
Of course, most of us do not have to be conditioned to feel repulsed by rape or torture.
But that does not mean that we are morally good or good enough.
As you read this, ordinary people somewhere in the world are doing unspeakable things to others.
Even in the most advanced and prosperous societies, it takes an enormous concerted effort to maintain even a modicum of decency: think castles, alarms, police, courts, and prisons.
And it is doubtful whether we really care enough about others or give enough to the less fortunate.
People are born with the ability to be moral, but it is a limited ability that is ill-equipped to deal with the ethical complexities of the modern world.
For thousands of years, people have relied on education, persuasion, social institutions, and the threat of real (or supernatural) punishment to get people to behave decently.
We could all be better morally, but it is clear that this traditional approach cannot take us much further.
It is not as if people suddenly start to behave better if we simply provide them with more facts and statistics or better arguments.
Therefore, we should not be too quick to dismiss the suggestion that science could primarily help by helping us design more effective institutions, more inspiring moral education, or more compelling ethical arguments.
But science could also offer more direct ways to influence our brains.
Science fiction sometimes limits rather than expands our sense of the possible.
It would be self-defeating, or worse, to try to boost morale through brutal coercion.
Governments must not be given the power to control their citizens, and we know that if they had that power, they would abuse it.
It would be ideal if individuals could freely explore various possibilities for self-improvement, be it by practicing mindfulness, reading moral philosophy or, yes, by taking a "moral pill."
But it is also true that although some people are eager to take pills that make them feel better or think faster, it is not so obvious that people really want to take pills that would make them morally better.
It is not clear whether people really want to be morally better.
And those who, like psychopathic Alex, need the most help are probably the ones who would least want it.
These are, of course, hypothetical questions.
We do not yet know what is possible.
But it is better to start the ethical discussion too early than too late.
And even if "moral pills" are only science fiction, they raise profound questions.
Will we want to take them if they ever become available?
And what does it say about us if we don't win?
A cloud over aviation safety
PRINCETON - When airports across Europe reopened following the closure caused by the eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull volcano, it was not because the amount of ash in the atmosphere had fallen, but because the risk the ash posed to aviation safety had been reassessed.
Was it new scientific evidence that led to the lifting of the ban, or was it a reflection of the personal and economic hardship caused by the ban?
Over six days, about 95,000 flights were canceled, costing airlines more than $1 billion.
An estimated five million people were stranded or delayed.
The British economy lost £1.5 billion, and others were similarly affected.
Flower growers in Kenya, who rely on air travel to bring their short-lived product to Europe, suddenly had no income.
Sixteen cancer patients who urgently needed bone marrow for transplants were at risk because the right bone marrow could not be flown in from the US or Canada.
In the past, jets flying to ash from volcanoes in the US, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Mexico have temporarily lost engine power, in one case dropping thousands of feet, though all managed to land safely.
But there was no evidence that the more scattered ash blowing over Europe from Iceland would cause similar problems.
The decision to fly on the ground was based on the view that any concentration of ash in the atmosphere posed some risk to aircraft and that it was up to the government to ensure safety, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said.
Indeed, in closing their airspace, European governments seem to have given absolute priority to safety above all else.
But in other areas, none of them act on this principle.
Every day, some 3,000 people die on the world's roads.
A speed limit of, say, 10 kilometres per hour would prevent most accidents and save many lives.
We are not doing so because safety is a lower priority than our desire to spend less time driving.
The price we are prepared to pay for security cannot be infinite.
It is distasteful to put a price on human lives, but the more we spend on security, the less we will have left for our other goals.
The British Government uses a figure of just over a million pounds as a general cap on the amount it is prepared to pay to save a statistical life, for example by improving road safety.
In the US, the Department of Transportation is willing to spend up to $5.8 million - almost four times as much - on the same purpose at current exchange rates.
Does this mean that security comes first in the US, but not in the UK?
Giovanni Bisignani, chief executive of the International Air Transport Association, an industry group, criticized the shutdown and said no risk assessment had been made.
By and large, however, the public seemed to support the decision.
Stranded travelers surveyed at airports typically said they would rather be stuck at an airport than on a plane falling from the sky.
But what if some travelers have a higher risk tolerance or simply a more urgent need for travel than others?
In his classic book On Liberty, John Stuart Mill considered a situation in which a man sets out to cross a bridge that we know is unsafe.
According to Mill, it is justified to stop him just to make sure he is aware of the danger.
Once he knows about it, he has to make the decision, because only he can assess the importance of his journey and weigh it against the risk he is taking.
Aviation safety is slightly different, because a crashing plane can kill people on the ground, but by far the biggest risks come from passengers and crew.
If they are fully aware of the risks and are still prepared to fly, perhaps they have been offered more money, as is often offered to workers in dangerous professions; should we discourage them from choosing to fly?
After test flights without passengers on board showed no engine damage and engine manufacturers informed the aviation authorities that their engines could operate safely with low levels of ash in the atmosphere, European airspace was finally reopened.
The International Civil Aviation Authority has announced that it will convene a group of experts to help the industry decide which levels of ash in the atmosphere make flying unsafe.
Now that we have seen how expensive it is to give absolute priority to safety, we know that this is not just a technical issue.
I trust that among the experts will be some who have reflected on the underlying ethical question: how safe should we be?
A Communist Party without Communism
PRINCETON - The appointment of Alexander Medvedev as Russian President Vladimir Putin's successor in next March's supposedly democratic presidential election shows that Russia's leaders have not minced their words.
It is looking increasingly likely that, as under Leonid Brezhnev, we will see the same names in the news in the decades to come.
According to Gleb Pavlovsky, the Putin regime's leading ideologue, Russia's current system is perfect in every sense except one: it does not know its enemies.
Indeed, it seems that everyone in the Kremlin is reading Carl Schmitt, the Nazi legal theorist who taught that naming the enemy is the central task of politics.
In the spirit of Schmitt, Putin's men have declared a liberal party, the Union of Right-wing Forces, their nemesis.
Their public meetings were dispersed by armed police; their leaders arrested and beaten; Putin called his supporters "coyotes."
Surprisingly, this aggressive behavior was in response to no discernible danger: oil prices are soaring, as are Putin's approval ratings.
His appointees control everything that matters, from Gazprom to the Central Election Committee.
Since the pacification of Chechnya with violence and subsidies, the imprisonment or emigration of a few financially viable opponents, and the massive social investment in recent years that, under Medvedev's personal supervision, bribed the population, no credible force can seriously challenge Putin's men.
But their regime is in crisis, and they know it.
Russia's economy is more dependent on gas and oil than ever before.
Military reform has been reversed.
Despite rising incomes, Russians are less educated and less healthy than they were when Putin took office; they are still dying at a shockingly young age.
Russian meddling in world affairs is tainted by poison and corruption.
State monopolies are destroying what private companies have created.
With more money, poorly trained bureaucrats hire more poorly trained bureaucrats; as a result, the regime fails to govern the country.
The country is rebellious, and its rulers know it.
So they panic.
Putin's goal was to bring all power under the control of Russia's security forces.
His generation of KGB officers observed the collapse of the Communist Party and all the government bodies it directed and controlled, including the KGB.
Under Putin, the secret service has retaliated.
Its people have become powerful, arrogant and immensely rich.
They have also become disobedient.
In 2004, General Viktor Cherkesov, then Putin's representative in northwestern Russia, published an essay glorifying the KGB as the only untainted authority in a corrupt country.
More than anything, this essay defined Putin's second term.
In October 2007, Cherkesov (now head of one of the most opaque and powerful services, the Federal Anti-Drug Administration) published another essay lamenting the degradation of his colleagues: warriors had become dealers, he complained.
Earlier, generals from the rival FSB domestic intelligence service arrested Cherkesov's deputy for "illegal wiretapping."
In a public gesture of desperation, Cherkesov acknowledged the failure of Putin's project to revive Russian leadership by subordinating it to the security services.
Cherkesov's deputy remains in jail.
Most believe that Putin is incapable of intervening in his defense.
In the absence of Communist Party control, these security officers betrayed their corporate ethics and engaged in horse-trading, using force when a deal was not going well.
That this is happening to ordinary Russians is clear; Cherkesov revealed that Putin's circle also faces this situation.
What to do when former KGB warriors turn their swords and bugs against each other?
Cherkesov's case illustrates Putin's nightmare.
But when your instincts betray you, you return to deeper ones.
Now that Putin's people have left behind the neoliberal ideas of their predecessors and feel disillusioned with the former KGB clique, the task is to restore a pervasive political party that controls the security services, the administration, the economy, and much else.
This party will be centralized under personal leadership and reduce the state to a legal fiction.
Managers preaching nationalism will believe in their universal competence, as opposed to KGB-style professionalism and corporatism.
Boris Yeltsin issued a decree banning party cells in state-controlled institutions.
Putin's lawyers will reverse this decision; the party will have cells or committees in every factory, every company, every military unit, every university department, etc.
Integrated by the charisma and party discipline of the party leader, the party members will run the country and unite.
This is Putin's plan.
Like former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, the only other KGB man to rule Russia, Putin becomes the party's general secretary.
As in the Soviet era, state and government officials are reduced to party ciphers - the role that President Medvedev will play under Secretary-General Putin.
And, of course, the Office of the Secretary-General has no constitutional term limit.
In the end, Putin has what history has left him: no ideas, just a faction longing to consolidate its power.
Lenin and Trotsky needed a party to make their ideology a reality.
Putin and Medvedev are devising an ideology to consolidate their party.
It's a bizarre ideology.
It accuses warriors of being traders and traders of being thieves, and shuns its Marxist origins.
It will subordinate all who really work for merchants, warriors, journalists, and others to party ideologues whose sole task is to look for enemies.
A Confederate Solution for Palestine
LONDON - When I was in New York City last month, I happened to be staying in the same hotel as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
To meet its security needs, the hotel had been converted into a fortress, much like Israel itself.
Netanyahu was in the United States for another round of Middle East peace talks.
The US offered various sweeteners to persuade Israel to freeze settlement construction in the West Bank for another 90 days.
The Israelis refused; another impasse was reached.
So what might be the prospects for a negotiated peace between two peoples with claims to the same land?
The answer is: very bad.
All peace efforts since the Oslo Accords of 1993 have been based on the "two-state solution," under which Israel would cede the occupied territories to a Palestinian state, the Palestinians would renounce all claims to the Jewish state, and everyone would live happily thereafter.
A negotiating country for a peace settlement remains official Western doctrine.
As US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it in a recent speech, "a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace" must be based on "two states for two peoples."
Meanwhile, the two main contenders, Palestine and Israel, are seeking unilateral alternatives to the stalled peace process, with the Palestinians pushing for international recognition of their state, while the Israelis are using their settlement policies to pre-empt a Palestinian state.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said that if the recent peace talks fail, he will push for the recognition of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders by the United Nations.
This month, Brazil and Argentina recognized Palestine, and a number of Latin American countries are expected to follow.
Abbas is now targeting Europe and would ask Turkey to act as a mediator.
The game is to use international recognition of an independent Palestinian state to put pressure on the US to abandon its almost unconditional support for Israeli policies.
Israel's main concern remains security.
The official Western doctrine is that Israel's long-term security depends on the success of the peace process.
In practice, Israel has taken other measures to secure its future.
The media's attention was focused on the "security wall," which has undoubtedly succeeded in reducing the level of violence.
But for the hawks who now control Israeli politics, the key to Israel's security depends on the depth of defense, for which settlement expansion is indispensable.
The hawks "recipe for survival is threefold: continued US military and economic support, defensible borders through a strategic settlement program, and the division of the Palestinian West Bank into segregated Bantustans, or subordinate authorities unable to form a concerted opposition to Israeli policies.
So, while Abbas is trying to create new facts on the ground by drumming up international support for a Palestinian state, Israel wants to trump him by rendering such a state unviable.
The ideal alternative to both strategies is a peace process that does not aim to create two states, but rather to create the political and economic basis for a single federal state.
Indeed, the two-state solution has always been an illusion.
There was never enough land to satisfy the passionate claim to ownership of all those who were entitled to it.
And over time, Israeli settlers "withdrawal from the West Bank and East Jerusalem has become as impossible as any attempt by Israel to expel its remaining Arabs.
Israeli Jews will inevitably remain in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Israeli Arabs will inevitably remain in Israel.
These are the facts on the ground that are as disastrous for Palestinian hopes for a sovereign Palestinian state as they are for Israeli hopes for a purely Jewish state.
Moreover, land for peace has never made economic sense.
If compensation for injustice to the Palestinians was to be the guiding principle, there were always better ways to do so than to create a rickety, poverty-stricken new country dependent on foreign aid.
Most people have forgotten that the Paris Protocols of April 1994 established a customs union between Israel and the Occupied Territories with a joint economic council to settle trade disputes.
The free movement of goods, labor, and capital between the two parts could have given a huge economic boost to Palestinian GDP.
It could also have been the basis for a federal state, the Palestinian part of which would have benefited from settlers in the West Bank.
But this favorable prospect was undermined by the violence needed to sustain the Jewish state and enable the emergence of a Palestinian state.
The official view remains that only an internationally guaranteed two-state solution will provide the security necessary for the economic revival of the Palestinian territories.
But it is entirely possible that unilateral Israeli policies, implicitly supported by the US, will create temporary peace conditions sufficient for economic growth to cool Palestinian nationalism.
The Palestinian cause is not the overriding concern of even Arab states, so Netanyahu's deep-seated defense strategy has a better chance of success than Abbas's quest for statehood through international recognition.
Netanyahu's project is not moral.
But that doesn't mean it won't work, at least for a while.
A Confederation for Kosovo
Time is running out in Kosovo.
Unless a United Nations-backed deal is reached by early December, the province's majority Albanian population is likely to declare independence unilaterally - a move that the United States may support.
That would be a catastrophic step.
Russia would be angry because it fears that Kosovo's secession, whether internationally recognized or not, could fuel separatist movements in the former Soviet empire.
Serbia is even more firmly opposed.
Dusan Prorokovic, Serbian Secretary of State for Kosovo, said his country could use force to preserve its sovereignty.
Even if the government hesitates, ultranationalist groups could push Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to send troops: the current UN presence in Kosovo is very thin (only 40 military observers and 2,116 police), but the deployment of 15,000 NATO troops could make any armed conflict very dangerous.
After eight years of international administration, Kosovo's Albanian majority has tasted freedom and is striving for full independence.
But Serbia maintains that the province remains an integral part of its historical and cultural tradition.
Moreover, independence would not be accepted by Serbian public opinion, which has already watched with dismay as "Greater Serbia" has gradually weakened, most recently with the secession of Montenegro.
Serbia is prepared to grant Kosovo only "enhanced autonomy" and some capacity to conclude international agreements.
But, while the two parties are now proving irreconcilable, it is not too late to reach a compromise.
However, this is only possible if an old institution of the international community is revived and updated: a confederation of states.
A binding UN Security Council resolution could give Kosovo full and exclusive authority over its citizens and territory, as well as limited capacity to act on the international stage.
It could be empowered to conclude trade agreements as well as agreements on individuals (e.g. reception and movement of foreigners or extradition), plus the right to apply for admission to the UN (which does not require full sovereignty and independence).
Kosovo would thus receive some essential insignia of statehood.
But a decision-making body made up of delegates from Kosovo, Serbia, and the European Union would gain full authority over key foreign policy issues (such as alliances and relations with international economic institutions), defense, borders (if Kosovo wanted to join Albania), and the treatment of Kosovo's Serb minority.
As a result, Kosovo and Serbia would be two distinct international entities bound by a confederation based on a joint decision-making body.
Of course, this confederation would be asymmetrical, because the Serbian government's sovereignty over the rest of Serbia would remain intact and unlimited, while the Kosovar government's sovereignty over Kosovo would be restricted.
In order to prevent one of the two parties from gaining the upper hand and forcing arbitrary decisions, the joint decision-making body should consist of four Serbian delegates, two Kosovar delegates and three EU representatives, which means that both sides need the support of the European delegates.
In addition, the EU should create a small but effective military force (around 5,000 soldiers) to support the decisions of the joint body.
As with any compromise, the bickering parties would both benefit and lose from this arrangement.
Serbia would save face and continue to have a say on key Kosovo issues, including the treatment of the Serb minority.
Kosovo would achieve limited independence, with its status moving from a province of a sovereign state to an international entity capable of concluding certain agreements with other states and even acceding to the UN.
The EU would also benefit by helping to stabilise a highly volatile region.
The EU would then monitor Kosovo and prevent any dispute that could turn into violence.
A final advantage of this solution is that it would be temporary.
Historically, confederations sooner or later either become federations (as happened in the US, Germany, and Switzerland) or they split under the pressure of centrifugal forces (like the United Arab Republic, which was founded in 1958 and split up three years later in Egypt and Syria).
The confederation that I advocate would thus constitute an intermediate phase (which will last five or ten years), at the end of which Kosovo will probably become fully independent.
Such a delay in reaching a final settlement would give time to examine Kosovo's prospects for EU accession, ultimately sharing "sovereign authority" with other independent states that could rebut Kosovo's dangerously robust nationalist demands.
A Conservative Europe
Last week, Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schröder met in Berlin.
They left with a promise to revive growth in Europe.
We have heard this empty promise before.
Instead, the European Union needs a new direction.
I say this as leader of the party that has been at the forefront of Britain's commitment to Europe.
It was a Conservative government that first applied for membership in the early 1960s.
In 1973, Britain was admitted to the European Economic Community by a Conservative government.
Margaret Thatcher worked with Jacques Delors in 1986 to create the single market.
So I have no doubt that Britain must remain influential within the Union.
But British policies toward the EU have often led to worse, rather than better, relations between member states.
Faced with a new EU initiative, our traditional response has often been to reject it, vote against it, lose the vote, and then sulkily accept it, while blaming everyone else.
Many Europeans are fed up with British vetoes.
Me too.
Of course, there are basic requirements that all member states must accept.
First and foremost, the four freedoms of the internal market: free movement of goods, services, people and capital.
But a single market does not require a single social or industrial policy, let alone a common tax policy.
Allowing countries to pursue their own policies in these areas promotes competitiveness.
Enforcement of common standards means that Europe will fall further behind if member states pass on their costs to their neighbors.
Which areas should be applied to each Member State and which should be optional?
I believe that each Member State should implement measures that do not directly and significantly affect other Member States.
In areas that serve their national interest, individual members should decide whether to maintain full national control or cooperate with others.
The members of the Union should form a series of overlapping circles: different compositions of members should be able to pool their responsibilities in different areas of their choice.
There are precedents for this.
NATO has been flexible from the outset.
France signed up for membership but later refused to place its forces under NATO's Central Command.
Similar flexibility exists for the euro, the Schengen Agreement and the social chapter.
These precedents can be extended.
Until now, everyone has had to move forward together, with individual countries negotiating specific derogations.
However, since 1998, there has been a procedure under the Treaties - so-called enhanced cooperation - which could allow some members to push ahead with further integration in a particular area without involving any other member.
Instead of individual member states conducting difficult negotiations to opt out of a new initiative, those who support it can simply agree.
Countries that want to integrate further can do so.
They do not have to drag Britain and others into their wake because the others are not forced to join them.
In this way, we can free ourselves from the institutionalised tug-of-war that has characterised EU relations.
I am not talking about a two-speed Europe.
This means that we all agree on the destination and differ only on the speed of the journey.
I do not want to achieve the goal that some of our partners are aiming for.
But I don't want to block their path.
There are some who say that this would mean a loss of influence on the part of countries that decide against closer integration.
But influence is not an end in itself - it is a means to an end.
Britain does not need a seat at the table when decisions are made about the euro.
Our economy has not been affected by staying out.
Keeping the pound does not mean rejecting the euro or hoping it will fail.
The European Union should stop trying everything and focus on doing fewer things more effectively.
It should give member states the chance to develop, within the EU framework, an approach to Europe that is consistent with their national traditions.
On this basis, the British Conservatives reject the draft Constitution.
We do not, of course, agree with many of the contents, but we are also opposed to the idea of having an EU constitution at all.
There is a world-wide difference between an association of contractual nation states and a single entity, whether or not it is called a state, with its own legal personality, which derives its authority from its own constitution.
If this Constitution were even remotely adopted in its proposed form, the EU would acquire many attributes and trappings of statehood: its own president and foreign minister, its own legal system.
The primacy of EU law would not derive from acts of national parliaments, but from a supranational constitution.
This is a radical change, not the clean-up that some are proposing.
I do not believe that it is right to make a change of this magnitude without specifically consulting the people on whose behalf we govern.
Elected parliaments do not have our freedoms.
They protect them and should not restrict these freedoms without an explicit mandate.
Any proposal for a new constitution must be put to the British people and the people of every EU member state.
A conspiracy so immense
NEW YORK - Is this the age of conspiracy theories?
There is much to suggest that we are in something of a golden age of citizen speculation, documentation, and reasoning, which usually takes shape on the Internet and goes viral around the world.
Conspiracy theories are carried from the fringes of public discourse, where they have generally been banished in the past, and sometimes to the center of politics.
I found out by accident.
After writing a book about the abduction of executive power in the United States in the Bush years, I came across online conversations telling stories of behind-the-scenes manipulation as I researched new developments.
There are some important issues.
In the US, global elites - including through the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations - often plot to establish a "one-world government" dominated by themselves, not national governments.
Sometimes more folkloristic details come into play and expand the members of this cabal to include the Illuminati, the Freemasons, the Rhodes scholars or, as always, the Jews.
The characteristics of this narrative are familiar to anyone who has studied the transfer of certain categories of narrative in times of crisis.
Literally, this conspiracy theory closely resembles the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which portray clandestine global elites with great power and wicked goals.
Historically, the themes tend to be the same: fearsome, uncontrolled transformative change, led by educated, urbanized cosmopolitans.
Students of the Weimar Republic know that sudden upheavals and shocks, rapid urbanization, disruption of traditional family and social ties, loosening of sexual restrictions, and economic collapse made many Germans susceptible to simplistic theories that seemed to address their confusion and give greater meaning to their suffering.
Similarly, the "9 / 11 Truth Movement" claims that Al Qaeda's attack on the Twin Towers was an "inside job."
There is a widespread conspiracy theory in the Muslim world that the Israelis were behind these attacks and that all Jews working in the buildings stayed at home that day.
Conspiracy theories usually crop up where people are poorly educated and there is no rigorous independent press.
So why are such theories gaining adherents in the US and other wealthy democracies today?
Today's explosion of conspiracy theories is fueled by the same conditions that drove their acceptance in the past: rapid social change and profound economic uncertainty.
A clearly identified "enemy" with an unequivocal "plan" is psychologically more comforting than the chaotic development of social norms and the functioning or failure of unbridled capitalism.
And while conspiracy theories are often patently irrational, the questions they raise are often healthy, even if the answers are often not, or simply, wrong.
Looking for answers, these citizens react rationally to irrational realities.
Many citizens rightly believe that their mass media fail to investigate and document abuses.
Newspapers in most developed countries struggle or buckle, and investigative reporting is often the first thing they cut off.
The concentration of media ownership and control further fuels public mistrust and prepares the ground for citizens to step into the vacuum.
At a time when corporate lobbyists have a free hand in shaping or even formulating public policies, many people rightly believe that their elected representatives no longer represent them.
Hence their impulse to believe in invisible forces.
Finally, even rational people have become more receptive to certain conspiracy theories, because we have actually seen some elaborate conspiracies in the last eight years.
The Bush administration conspired to lead Americans and others into an illegal war using fabricated evidence.
Is it any wonder, then, that so many rational people are trying to make sense of a political reality that has really become unusually opaque?
If even the 9 / 11 Commissioners contradict their own conclusions (because they were based on evidence derived from torture), is it surprising that many want a second investigation?
Often enough, citizens are on the fringes of discourse, pursuing theories that report news that are ignored by the mainstream media.
For example, it took a "conspiracy theorist," Alex Jones, to uncover the documentation of microwave technologies used by police against US citizens.
The New Yorker confirmed the story much later, without naming the original source.
The mainstream media's tendency not to verify or report what conspiracy theories are actually newsworthy on the Internet partly reflects class bias.
Conspiracy theories are considered vulgar and vile.
So even good, critical questions or well-researched data brought to light by citizen investigators tend to be considered radioactive by highly educated formal journalists.
The real problem with these frenetic conspiracy theories is that they leave citizens emotionally agitated, but without solid evidence on which to base their worldview, and without constructive directions in which to channel their emotions.
That is why so many threads of discussion turn from potentially interesting citizen speculation into hate speech and paranoia.
In a feverish environment without good editorial validation or procurement tools, citizens can be robbed and flogged by demagogues, as we saw at Sarah Palin's rallies in recent weeks, after Internet theories portrayed Barack Obama as a terrorist or in league with terrorists.
We need to change the flow of information in the Internet age.
Citizens should be better able to disseminate information, spread stories, and send clues to mainstream investigative reporters.
They should organize new online companies in which they pay a fee for direct investigative reporting that is not influenced by corporate pressure.
And citizen investigators should be trained in basic journalistic skills: finding good data, confirming stories with two independent sources, using quotes responsibly, and avoiding anonymity, that is, standing by their own viewpoints, as conventional reporters do.
In this way, citizens can be taken seriously and themselves taken seriously as documentarians and investigators of our common situation.
In an age of official lies, healthy investigative energy should shed light, not just generate heat.
A constitutional coup in Ukraine
Constitutional change is always a risky business.
But it is extremely dangerous if it benefits only one man.
When a president volunteers to curtail the powers of his own office, one can be sure that he is not doing a good job.
This is exactly what is happening in Ukraine, where President Leonid Kuchma is proposing to scrap our presidential system and replace it with a strange parliamentary system that he has come up with.
Kuchma did not suddenly take the view that parliamentary democracies are better than presidential ones.
No, Kuchma wants to change the Ukrainian constitution for no other reason than to keep his power.
Today Kuchma rules as an all-powerful president.
But his term ends next year and he cannot run again.
So, instead of retiring with dignity, as presidents from Bill Clinton to Boris Yeltsin routinely do, Kuchma wants to change the constitution to become an all-powerful prime minister who will never be subject to term limits.
Of course, constitutions are not there to protect the status quo when the status quo is rotten.
Constitutions can and should take account of reforms when necessary.
But a powerful president is not necessarily wrong for Ukraine.
In our painful post-communist transition, it is vital that a government can act decisively.
A good reason is needed to change a system that best suits Ukraine's circumstances.
The Ukrainian president is empowered to appoint and dismiss the prime minister, dissolve parliament if he wishes, and govern by decree if he sees the country's institutions at risk.
He retains daily control over every aspect of government.
A Caesar must therefore be above reproach.
Kuchma did not.
On the contrary, what is rotten in Ukraine is not its constitution, but its president, embroiled in allegations of corruption and orchestrating the murder of journalists and shunned by other heads of state and government.
As president, Kuchma is grotesquely unpopular.
Even Slobodan Milosevic had more support in Yugoslavia before his fall.
Kuchma knows that he cannot rely on having his successor hand-picked, as Yeltsin did in Russia.
Unable to secure a tame successor for the presidency, Kuchma wants a "parliamentary republic" with a weak president and a powerful prime minister.
But the parliament he has in mind is a mutation, one in which the authoritarian rule of the Kuchma criminal clans will continue unabated behind the façade of parliamentary procedure.
People all too easily forget Ukraine, that great country on the border of the soon-to-be-enlarged European Union.
But any attempt to prolong Kuchma's rule will create such a political mess that it is not absurd to fear that Ukraine could follow Belarus and the Balkans into direct dictatorship and chaos in the early 1990 "s.
Indeed, this scenario could get worse, because Russia is unlikely to stand idly by as Ukraine disintegrates.
Intervention of any kind seems more likely in such circumstances.
Only an imperial Russia, however, would dare to absorb Ukraine again.
But an imperial Russia cannot be a democratic Russia.
Kuchma thus endangers not only freedom and human rights in Ukraine, but ultimately also Russian democracy.
Fortunately, there has never been a better time for the West - especially the EU - to pull Ukraine back from the brink.
With EU enlargement looming next spring, all Ukrainians fear that a new wall will cut their country off from the Union's easternmost border in Poland.
Although maintaining Ukrainian democracy is primarily a task for Ukrainians, the EU can help by taking practical steps to assure Ukrainians that they will not be cut off from the rest of Europe.
A generous visa regime and the use of regional development funds in Ukraine to benefit impoverished eastern Poland are two possible incentives.
However, these should be conditional on Kuchma leaving the country's constitution and democracy alone.
The EU should not worry about interference in Ukraine's internal affairs.
After all, a few years ago it did not hesitate to draw the attention of a current Member State, Austria, to the fact that it was concerned about the welfare of that country's democracy.
The wayward Kuchma deserves much more for Europe to impose protective measures to ensure his good behaviour.
Similarly, the US should view Kuchma's decision to send troops to Iraq with caution.
America's loyalty to democracy in Ukraine cannot be bought so cynically.
Within Ukraine, a government that is capable of truly governing should try to adopt EU laws and norms in exactly the same way as the candidate countries have done, thereby helping to clean up the opaque system in which Kuchma's criminal cronies thrive.
The Constitution must be reformed, but not to transfer power from one irresponsible leader to another.
What we need are clear controls on arbitrariness and transparency in decision-making.
No one should doubt that Kuchma intends to stay in power no matter what.
Less certain is whether he will feel secure enough to hold presidential (or other) elections unless he can amend the constitution in a way that guarantees his continued mismanagement.
After all, it is President Kuchma who is discredited, not Ukraine's constitutional arrangements.
A contagion of bad ideas
NEW YORK - The Great Recession of 2008 has turned into a North Atlantic recession: Europe and the United States, not the major emerging economies, are mired in a quagmire of slow growth and high unemployment.
And it is Europe and America that are marching alone and together to the brink of a major debacle.
A burst bubble led to a massive Keynesian stimulus that prevented a much deeper recession, but also fueled sizable budget deficits.
The response to massive spending cuts means that unacceptably high unemployment (a huge waste of resources and an excess of suffering) may persist for years to come.
The European Union has finally committed itself to helping its financially distressed members.
It had no choice: as the financial turmoil threatened to spread from small countries like Greece and Ireland to large ones like Italy and Spain, the euro's survival was increasingly in jeopardy.
Europe's leaders recognized that the debts of distressed countries would become unmanageable if their economies could not grow, and that growth could not be achieved without help.
But, even as European leaders promised that aid was on the way, they redoubled the belief that non-crisis countries must cut spending.
The resulting austerity measures will hamper growth in Europe, and hence in the worst-hit economies: after all, nothing would help Greece more than robust growth among its trading partners.
And low growth will hurt tax revenues and undermine the stated goal of fiscal consolidation.
The discussions before the crisis showed how little has been done to repair economic fundamentals.
The European Central Bank's vehement opposition to what is essential for all capitalist economies, namely the restructuring of failed or insolvent companies and debts, is evidence of the continuing fragility of the Western banking system.
The ECB argued that taxpayers should foot the full bill for Greece's bad government bonds, fearing that any private-sector involvement would trigger a credit event that would force large payouts on credit default swaps (CDS), potentially fueling further financial turmoil.
But if that is a real fear for the ECB, if it is not just acting on behalf of private lenders, then it should have demanded that the banks have more capital.
Likewise, the ECB should have excluded banks from the risky CDS market, where they are held hostage by credit rating agencies and decisions about what constitutes a credit event.
Indeed, it was a positive achievement of European leaders at the recent summit in Brussels to begin the process of reining in both the ECB and the power of America's credit rating agencies.
The most curious thing about the ECB's position was its threat not to accept restructured government bonds as collateral if the rating agencies decide to classify the restructuring as a credit event.
The purpose of the restructuring was to reduce debt and manage the rest better.
If the bonds were acceptable as collateral before the restructuring, they were certainly safer after the restructuring and therefore equally acceptable.
This episode is a reminder that central banks are political institutions with a political agenda, and that independent central banks tend to be (at least cognitively) captured by the banks they are supposed to regulate.
And on the other side of the Atlantic, things are hardly better.
There, the far right threatened to paralyze the US government, confirming what game theory suggests: when those who are irrationally committed to destruction, if they fail to prevail, meet rational individuals, the former prevail.
As a result, President Barack Obama agreed to an unbalanced debt-reduction strategy, with no tax increases, not even for the millionaires who have done so well over the past two decades, and not even by eliminating tax giveaways to oil companies that undermine economic efficiency and contribute to environmental degradation.
Optimists argue that the short-term macroeconomic impact of the agreement to raise the US debt ceiling and avoid default next year will be limited to about $25 billion in spending cuts.
But the payroll tax cut (which put more than $100 billion in the pockets of ordinary Americans) has not been extended, and companies that anticipate the contractionary effects across the board will certainly be even more reluctant to lend.
The end of the stimulus package itself is contractionary.
And, with house prices continuing to fall, GDP growth stagnant, and unemployment stubbornly high (one in six Americans who would like to get a full-time job still do not), further stimulus, not austerity, is needed, including to balance the budget.
The main driver of deficit growth is weak tax revenues from poor economic performance; the best panacea would be to get America back to work.
The latest debt agreement is a step in the wrong direction.
There is great concern about financial contagion between Europe and America.
After all, America's financial mismanagement has played an important role in causing Europe's problems, and financial turmoil in Europe would not be good for the US - especially given the fragility of the US banking system and the ongoing role it plays in non-transparent CDSs.
But the real problem stems from another form of contagion: bad ideas easily cross borders, and misguided economic ideas on both sides of the Atlantic reinforce each other.
The same is true of the stagnation that this policy entails.
Global Warming's Cool Calculus
The UK Government has recently published the most comprehensive study yet on the economic costs and risks of global warming, as well as measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in the hope of averting some of the worst consequences.
Led by Sir Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, who succeeded me as chief economist of the World Bank, the report makes it clear that the question is no longer whether we can afford to do something about global warming, but whether we can afford not to.
The report proposes an agenda whose cost would be only 1% of annual consumption, but which would save the world five times as much risk premiums.
The reported costs of global warming are higher than in previous studies, because they take into account the mounting evidence that the process of global warming is highly complex and non-linear, with a negligible chance that it will proceed much faster than previously thought, and that the extent of warming may be much greater than previously thought.
Indeed, the study could significantly underestimate the costs: climate change could lead to more weather variability, a possible disappearance or major shift of the Gulf Stream, which is of particular importance to Europe, and the spread of diseases.
In 1995, when I was a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the scientific group that periodically assesses the science of global warming, there was overwhelming evidence that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had increased significantly since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, that human activities had contributed significantly to these increases, and that they would have profound effects on the climate and sea levels.
But few, for example, have seen the Arctic ice cap melt as fast as it seems to be now.
Still, some suggest that we should do little or nothing, because we are not sure how bad global warming will be.
In my opinion, uncertainty should lead us to act more decisively today, not less.
As a scientist friend puts it: if you are driving on a mountain road, approaching a cliff, in a car whose brakes may fail and a bank of fog rolls in, should you drive more or less carefully?
Global warming is one of those rare cases where the scientific community is more afraid of what might happen than the population as a whole.
Scientists have guessed what the future might hold.
As the Stern report shows, the poor are, as always, the most vulnerable.
A third of Bangladesh will be submerged by the end of this century.
The Maldives and a whole series of Pacific island states will disappear: our 21st century Atlantis.
To an economist, the problem is obvious: polluters do not pay the full cost of the damage they cause.
Pollution is a global external phenomenon of enormous proportions.
Developed countries may not harm Bangladesh and the vanished island states, but no war could be more devastating.
Global external effectiveness can best be managed through a globally agreed tax rate.
This does not mean an increase in overall taxation, but only that in each country a pollution tax (carbon tax) takes the place of some current taxes.
It makes much more sense to tax things that are bad, such as pollution, than things that are good, such as savings and labour.
Although President George W. Bush says he believes in markets, he has called for voluntary action in this case.
But it makes far more sense to harness the power of markets and incentives than to rely on goodwill, especially when it comes to oil companies whose sole goal is to maximize profits, regardless of the cost to others.
Exxon reportedly funds so-called think tanks to undermine confidence in the science of global warming, just as the tobacco industry funds research to challenge the validity of statistical evidence supporting the link between smoking and cancer.
Some companies even seem to celebrate the melting of the polar caps, because it will reduce the cost of extracting the oil that lies beneath the Arctic Ocean.
The good news is that there are many ways to reduce emissions through improved incentives - in part, by eliminating myriad subsidies for inefficient use.
The US subsidizes corn-based ethanol and imposes tariffs on sugar-based ethanol; the tax code conceals billions of dollars in subsidies for the oil and gas industry.
Most importantly, price signals that reveal the true social costs of fossil-fuel-derived energy promote innovation and environmental protection.
Small changes in practice, when adopted by hundreds of millions of people, can make a huge difference.
For example, simply changing the colour of roofs in warm climates to reflect sunlight, or planting trees around houses, can lead to large energy savings in air conditioning.
We only have one planet and we should cherish it.
Global warming is a risk that we simply cannot ignore any longer.
A crisis in two narratives
CHICAGO - With the world's advanced democracies in crisis, two competing narratives about their sources and appropriate remedies are emerging.
The first, better-known diagnosis is that demand has collapsed, owing to the high levels of debt accumulated before the crisis.
Households (and countries) most vulnerable to spending can no longer borrow.
To stimulate growth, others must be encouraged to spend; governments that can still borrow should run larger deficits; and low interest rates should discourage thrifty households from saving.
In these circumstances, fiscal ruthlessness is a virtue, at least in the short term.
In the medium term, when growth picks up, debt can be repaid and the financial sector can be contained so that it does not inflict another crisis on the world.
This narrative - the standard Keynesian line modified for a debt crisis - is the narrative that most government officials, central bankers, and Wall Street economists have embraced, and requires little elaboration.
Its virtue is that it gives policymakers something clear to do, with promised returns consistent with the political cycle.
Unfortunately, despite past stimulus programs, growth is still weak, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to find sensible new spending that can pay off in the short term.
Attention is therefore shifting to the second narrative, which suggests that advanced countries "basic ability to grow by doing useful things has been declining for decades - a trend that has been obscured by debt-financed spending.
More such spending will not put these countries on a sustainable growth path.
Instead, they must improve the environment for growth.
The second narrative begins with the 1950 "s and 1960" s, an era of rapid growth in the West and Japan.
Several factors underpinned the long boom, including post-war reconstruction, the revival of trade after the protectionist 1930 "s, the adoption of new energy, transport, and communications technologies across national borders, and the expansion of education levels.
But, as Tyler Cowen argues in his book The Great Stagnation, after these low-hanging fruits were harvested in the 1970 "s, it became much harder to drive growth.
Meanwhile, as Wolfgang Streeck convincingly writes in the New Left Review, democratic governments that faced an endless prospect of innovation and growth in the 1960 "s were quick to expand the welfare state.
But when growth faltered, it meant that government spending rose, even as its resources shrank.
For a time, central banks accommodated this spending.
The resulting high inflation generated widespread discontent, largely because it produced little growth.
Belief in Keynesian stimulus waned, even as high inflation reduced public debt.
As a result, central banks began to focus on low and stable inflation as their primary goal, becoming more independent of their political masters.
But government deficit spending continued rapidly, and public debt as a share of GDP in advanced countries has been rising steadily since the late 1970 "s, this time without inflation, to reduce its real value.
Recognizing the need to find new sources of growth, the United States deregulated industry and finance toward the end of Jimmy Carter's presidency and then under Ronald Reagan, as Margaret Thatcher did in Britain.
Productivity growth in these countries has increased considerably over time, prompting continental Europe to embark on its own reforms, often driven by the European Commission.
But even that growth was not enough, given previous governments "generous promises to provide health care and pensions, made even more unsustainable by rising life expectancy and declining birth rates.
Public debt continued to grow.
And the incomes of the moderately educated middle class did not benefit from deregulatory growth (though it did improve their lot as consumers).
The recent phase of industrialized countries "frantic search for growth has taken various forms.
In some countries, particularly the US, a private-sector credit boom created jobs in low-skill industries such as construction and triggered a consumer boom, as people borrowed against overvalued homes.
In other countries, such as Greece, and among regional administrations in Italy and Spain, a government-led wave of hiring has created secure jobs for the moderately educated.
In this "fundamental" narrative, advanced countries "pre-crisis GDP was unsustainable, underpinned by borrowing and unproductive jobs.
Pumping up growth - the Keynesian formula - may create the illusion of normality, and be useful immediately after a deep crisis to calm a panic, but it is not a solution to a fundamental growth problem.
If this diagnosis is correct, developed countries must focus in the medium term on reviving innovation and productivity growth, reconciling welfare promises with revenue capacity, while alleviating the plight of the truly needy in the short term.
For example, Southern Europe's growth potential could consist of deregulating the service sector and reducing dismissal protections to stimulate the creation of more private-sector jobs for laid-off government workers and unemployed youth.
In the US, the imperative is to improve the match between potential jobs and workers "skills.
People understand better than the government what they need and act accordingly.
For example, many women leave low-paying jobs to acquire skills that open the door to better-paying positions.
Such issues have received too little government attention, partly because successes have transcended electoral horizons, and partly because the effectiveness of government programs has been patchy.
But tax reform can stimulate retraining and incentives to work, even as it plugs gaping budget holes.
Three powerful forces, it is hoped, will help create more productive jobs in the future: better use of information and communications technology (and new ways to make it more rewarding), cheaper energy as an alternative source, and sharply rising demand in emerging markets for higher-value-added goods.
Developed countries have a choice.
They can pretend that everything is fine, except that their consumers are on the radio and that "animal spirits" need to be revived through incentives.
Or they can view the crisis as a wake-up call to address the debts that have accumulated in recent decades.
For better or worse, the narrative that convinces these countries, governments, and the public will determine their future and that of the global economy.
A crisis of confidence
LONDON - Public confidence in financial institutions and the authorities they were supposed to regulate was an early victim of the financial crisis.
This is hardly surprising, since firms that were once revered revealed that they did not fully understand the instruments they were trading with or the risks they were taking.
It is hard for the masters of the universe not to enjoy this comedy.
But if this loss of confidence continues, it could cost us all dearly.
As Ralph Waldo Emerson observed, "Our mistrust is very expensive." The Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow put it in economic terms nearly 40 years ago: "It can be plausibly argued that much of the world's economic backwardness can be explained by a lack of mutual trust."
Indeed, extensive economic research has shown a strong relationship between the level of trust in a community and its overall economic performance.
Without mutual trust, economic activity is severely limited.
Even within Europe, there is strong evidence that countries where mutual trust is higher attract more investment, particularly through venture capital investment, and are willing to use more flexible contracts that are also beneficial for growth and investment.
So if it is true that confidence in financial institutions and in the governments that supervise them has been damaged by the crisis, we should be very concerned about that and we should develop responses that seek to restore that confidence.
Indeed, the evidence of a crisis of confidence is rather difficult to interpret.
In Britain, the latest poll results are mixed.
Surveys conducted by financial firms tend to show that trust in them has not diminished much, and that people trust them even more than they trust the National Health Service or the BBC.
BBC-sponsored surveys tend to show the opposite.
Banks cite statistics to show that they are trusted more than supermarkets, while supermarkets provide evidence that the opposite is true, and are expanding into the financial services sector in the belief that the public will trust them more than the banks, which have had to be bailed out dearly by the government.
The market will prove one side right not long to come.
In the United States, there is now a more systematic, independent survey sponsored by economists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
Its financial confidence index, based on a large-scale survey of financial decision-makers in American households, showed a steep decline in confidence after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in late 2008 and early 2009.
This loss of confidence affected banks, the stock market, and the government and its regulators.
In addition, the survey showed that declining confidence was strongly correlated with financial behavior.
In other words, if your confidence in the market and the way it is regulated fell sharply, you were less likely to deposit money in banks or invest in stocks.
So the dwindling confidence has had real economic consequences.
Fortunately, the latest survey, published in July this year, shows that confidence in banks and bankers has gradually recovered, and quite sharply.
This has had a positive impact on the stock market.
Moreover, confidence in the government's response and in financial regulation is slightly higher than at the end of last year.
The latter point, no doubt reflecting the Obama administration's attempts to reform the dysfunctional system it inherited, is particularly important, because the sharpest declines in investment intentions were among those who had lost confidence in the government's regulatory capacity.
It seems that restoring confidence in the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission is more economically important than restoring confidence in Citibank or AIG.
Continued bickering in Congress over the precise details of the reform could therefore have economic costs if the perception prevails that the system will not be overhauled.
All of this data is at an overall level, reflecting the average views of voters and investors.
But we also know that the individual views are remarkably heterogeneous.
Some people have great confidence in others and in the companies and institutions with which they do business.
Others are inherently suspicious.
Researchers from the European University Institute in Florence and UCLA have recently shown that there is a relationship between trust and income.
A Europe-wide opinion poll, which has been carried out for many years, enables us to relate these two aspects.
It asks simple but effective questions about the extent to which individuals are inclined to trust those they are dealing with.
Interestingly, the data show that those with confidence well below the average of the country in which they live are likely to have lower incomes.
Is this only because low-income people feel that life is unfair and therefore mistrust their neighbors?
This does not seem to be the case, because it is also true that very trusting people have a lower income than the average.
In other words, if you stray significantly from the average level of trust in society, you are likely to lose, either because you mistrust others so much that you miss out on investment opportunities and mutually beneficial exchanges, or because you are so trusting that you expose yourself to fraud and abuse.
When someone I don't know says "trust me," an irritating type of conversation, I usually close my wallet.
Perhaps so do most academics, who are at the lower end of the scale of skills and skill-adjusted incomes.
Perhaps we should trust each other more, but not too much.
A crisis of understanding
NEW HAVEN - Few economists predicted the current economic crisis, and there is little agreement among them on its ultimate causes.
Not surprisingly, economists are not in a good position to predict how quickly it will end.
Of course, we all know the immediate causes of an economic crisis: people do not spend because their incomes have fallen, their jobs are insecure, or both.
But we can go a step further: people's incomes are lower and their jobs are insecure because they have not spent money recently, and so on, in a repetitive feedback loop.
It's a vicious circle, but where and why did it start?
Why has it got worse?
What will it turn around?
It is these questions to which economists have been unable to provide clear answers.
In the Great Depression that followed the stock market crash of 1929, economic knowledge was just as bad.
Economists had not predicted this event, either.
In the 1920s, some warned of an overpriced stock market, but they did not predict a decade-long depression that would affect the entire economy.
At the end of the Great Depression, in August 1938, an article by Ralph M. Blagden in The Christian Science Monitor reported an informal series of interviews with US professors, banking experts, union leaders, and representatives of business associations and political groups, all of whom were asked the same question: "What causes recessions?"
The reasons given were broadly distributed among government, labour, industry, international politics and politics.
These included misguided government intervention in markets, high income and capital-gains taxes, misguided monetary policies, pressure on high wages, monopolies, overcrowding, uncertainty stemming from the Supreme Court's reorganization plan, rearmament in Europe and fear of war, government support for labor struggles, a savings glut resulting from population decline, border crossing, and easy pre-depression lending.
Although economic theory is much better today, when we ask people about the causes of the current crisis, we will mostly get the same answers, and we will certainly hear some new ones: unprecedented housing bubbles, a global savings glut, international trade imbalances, exotic financial contracts, subprime mortgages, unregulated OTC markets, credit rating agencies, mistakes, compromised real estate valuations, and complacency about counterparty risk.
More likely, many or most of these people would be mostly or partially right, because the economic crisis was caused by a confluence of many factors, the accidental confluence of a lot of bad things that pushed the financial system beyond its limits.
At that point, the problem attracted widespread attention, destroyed public confidence, and set in motion a negative feedback loop.
Finally, of course, our attention is drawn to the worst events.
Precisely because the worst events are statistical outliers, their causes are probably manifold.
Consider the question of predicting events such as the earthquake in Haiti in January 2010, which killed more than 200,000 people.
It caught our attention because it was so bad in terms of human lives and property damage.
But if one went beyond trying to predict the occurrence of earthquakes to predict the extent of the damage, one could certainly develop a long list of influencing factors - including even political, financial, and insurance factors - similar to the list of factors that caused the global economic crisis. Indeed, the crisis knows no end to the list of causes.
Indeed, in a complicated economic system that feeds on itself in many ways, events that set a vicious circle in motion may seem as trivial as the proverbial butterfly in the Amazon, which, by flapping its wings, sets in motion a chain of events that eventually leads to a far-off hurricane.
The chaos theory of mathematics explains this dependence on remote and seemingly trivial initial conditions and explains why even the extrapolation of seemingly precise planetary movements becomes impossible if carried far enough into the future.
Even weather experts cannot predict far into the future, but at least they have accurate mathematical models.
Massive parallel computers are programmed to provide numerical solutions to differential equations derived from the theory of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics.
Scientists seem to know the mechanism that generates weather, even if it is inherently difficult to extrapolate very far.
The problem for macroeconomics is that the causes of the current crisis are difficult to systematise.
The mathematical models that macroeconomists have may in some respects resemble weather models, but their structural integrity is guaranteed by nothing like a solid, immutable theory.
The most important new book on the origins of the economic crisis, Carmen Reinhart's and Kenneth Rogoff's This Time Is Different, is essentially a summary of the lessons learned from virtually every financial crisis in every country in history.
But the book is almost entirely untheoretical.
It merely documents recurring patterns.
Unfortunately, in 800 years of financial history, there is only one example of a truly massive global downturn, the Great Depression of the 1930 "s.
It is therefore difficult to say exactly what to expect in the current contraction based on the Reinhart-Rogoff analysis.
A cure for fiscal failure?
CAMBRIDGE - Should more countries set up independent tax advisory bodies to bring more objectivity to national budget debates?
Jailed fraudster Bernie Madoff recently summed up many people's feelings about fiscal policy, declaring that "the entire government is a Ponzi scheme."
Perhaps this was just wishful thinking from a man who will die in prison after his own record-breaking $50 billion Ponzi scheme collapsed in 2008.
Personally, I suspect Madoff's unenviable place in the record books will be safe for some time to come.
But, with many of the world's largest governments facing a lethal combination of unsustainable conventional debt, unprecedented pension liabilities, and a slowdown in growth, one has to wonder what the fiscal plan looks like.
Carmen M. Reinhart and I show in our new paper, "A Decade of Debt," that general government debt in the United States, including federal, state, and local debt, has now surpassed the record 120% of GDP reached at the end of World War II.
Japan is, of course, even worse off, with total public debt exceeding 200% of GDP.
Although this is partially offset by foreign-exchange reserves, Japan now faces enormous costs for disaster relief - in addition to its depressing demographic.
In many other rich countries, too, debt levels are uncomfortably close to 150-year highs, despite relative peace in much of the world.
There is no easy way out.
At the moment, low interest rates around the world are holding back the cost of servicing debt, but debt levels can be reduced only very gradually over long periods, while real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates can rise much faster, even for rich countries.
Debt crises tend to come out of the blue and hit countries whose debt performance simply leaves no room for error or unplanned adversity.
The most immediate and direct effect of independent fiscal policy would be to control spending by creating a counterpoint to the government's Panglossian growth and revenue projections.
In principle, an independent and respected advisory board could also force governments to acknowledge the hidden costs of government guarantees and off-balance-sheet debt.
It is high time to think about new approaches.
Of course, no simple change will eliminate the enormous propensity for deficit spending in most modern political systems.
And no simple change will eliminate the risk of future debt and inflation crises.
Many countries need major reforms to make their tax systems more efficient and their entitlement programs - including their pension systems - more realistic.
The recent establishment of tax advisory bodies is a promising institutional start.
A number of countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, the US, and Belgium, have longstanding financial regulators, such as the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO).
But, while these older institutions have proved enormously useful, they are usually fairly limited.
For example, the CBO is free to make long-term budget projections based on its own best growth estimates, but it is largely forced to take politically implausible future corrections at face value, somewhat neutralizing the potential effectiveness of any criticism of deficit policy.
To enhance credibility, a number of governments are seeking to create more independent fiscal councils, often with central banks as models.
The new vanguard includes councils in Sweden, Great Britain, Slovenia and Canada.
The remit of the Swedish Fiscal Council is particularly broad, giving it a mandate not only to make forecasts, but also to scrutinize the motives and consequences of government policy.
In principle, an independent fiscal council could have provided invaluable help during the financial crisis.
In the US, such an agency could have weighed the costs and benefits of bailouts, which might have helped end congressional paralysis and strained nerves to offer taxpayers more upside risk.
It is too much to expect that these new fiscal institutions will become as important or powerful as central banks, at least for the foreseeable future.
There is far more consensus on monetary policy than on fiscal policy.
And fiscal policy is much more complex and multi-layered.
Nonetheless, the general principle seems to be an important step toward fiscal sanity.
Of course, fiscal councils alone, no matter how well designed, are not enough.
It will remain very tempting for any generation to say, "My grandchildren will be two or three times richer than I am, so who cares if they have to pay down debt?" Moreover, the political cycle creates a very strong deficit distortion, as politicians try to embellish feelings of economic health and prosperity by increasing visible spending at the expense of hidden debt and lower long-term investment.
To withstand these powerful pressures, fiscal councils must have their work regularly reviewed by international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, both to protect their independence and to promote accountability.
Of course, Bernie Madoff may still be right, and his plan will not turn out to be the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.
But greater transparency and a more systematic independent assessment of government policy could be a very helpful step toward solving the eternal conundrum of outsize deficits.
It is certainly one of the more innovative and promising ideas to emerge from a rather barren political landscape.
A Customs Union for the Balkans
The fall of Milosevic does not cure the Balkans "political woes, but increases their urgency.
Yugoslavia has disintegrated, but the disintegration is incomplete.
In Yugoslavia, Vojislav Kostunica was elected president, but his mandate rests solely on Serbia's support.
Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in the Yugoslav Federation, largely boycotted the election, while Kosovo's Albanians ignored it.
But it was Yugoslavia, whose foundations are unstable, that was recently admitted to the UN.
A host of issues remain unresolved: relations between Serbia and Montenegro, and the status of Kosovo (not to mention Serbia's northern province of Vojvodina).
Any solution, any amendment, will create new conflicts because of conflicting claims to sovereignty.
As tempting as it may be to solve the puzzle by drawing new boundaries or creating new entities, this puzzle cannot be solved in terms of sovereignty.
This traditional solution would only perpetuate the problems of the Balkans.
A new approach is needed: the European Union should use the prospect of European integration as a way to promote regional integration.
The EU could act as a magnet to bring the region closer together by bringing the region as a whole closer to Europe.
This idea is very attractive to the people of the region, but only the EU can make it a reality.
Following NATO's intervention in Kosovo, European leaders made this approach the cornerstone of their vision for the Balkans.
It was enshrined in the Stability Pact signed at the Sarajevo Summit in July 1999.
However, the Stability Pact is just an envelope that needs to be filled with content.
The timing is at the conference in Zagreb on 24 November, convened by France as the current President of the EU.
The European Union should now propose a three-point plan for the Balkans:
$a customs union with preferential access to the EU markets within one year. The model should be the existing customs union between the EU and Turkey.
Once all these countries reach an agreement with the EU, there would automatically be free trade throughout the Balkans.
Implementation will take some time.
But from the outset, the EU should send a signal by unilaterally opening its border to imports from the region.
This cannot jeopardise EU interests, as the countries concerned currently have far less than 1% of the EU market.
Regional VAT should be introduced within two years to replace lost customs revenue.
Differences in indirect taxes, such as VAT, are another way of turning borders into barriers to trade.
They should be united throughout the region.
Regional VAT rates could easily be increased if expenditure restraint is not sufficient to compensate for the loss of customs revenue due to the Customs Union.
$Temporary budget support on a decreasing scale for three years, subject to EU supervision of budgetary expenditure.
As the collection of revenue from regional VAT will take some time, the EU should provide financial assistance during the transition.
The area covered by the plan would include Bulgaria, Croatia and Albania, as well as Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo.
The participation of Romania and Moldova is optional.
Bulgaria and Croatia could be persuaded to participate, provided that they did not interfere in their candidacies for EU membership.
Depending on the country, there could be more or less budget support.
(Bulgaria, for example, may not need compensation, as it has already eliminated tariffs on a large scale).
Compared to the cost of military intervention and peacekeeping, the financial cost is ridiculously low.
I estimate that EUR 750 million in the first year, EUR 500 million in the second year and EUR 250 million in the third year would be enough.
(If Romania and Moldova were included, the figures would be slightly higher).
These figures are well within the range of the commitments the EU has already made to the Stability Pact, and they could easily be taken into account within the bounds of the Berlin agreement on the EU budget for 2000-2005, if EU member states agree to redistribute unspent funds.
Budgetary support under a customs union would be a more effective way of disbursing EU funds than traditional methods.
This three-point programme would lay the foundations for economic recovery.
It would eliminate two main sources of corruption and inefficiency: the customs service and the misuse of public funds in general.
It would create a trade zone large enough to generate both local and foreign investment.
The Deutschmark, already widely used in the region, now functions as a de facto common currency.
Any ban on its use should be lifted to make borders irrelevant for trade and investment.
Better economic prospects and strengthening of institutions would in turn have a positive impact on the political climate throughout the Balkans.
Serbia has come out of the abyss part of the way.
Success in peacefully removing a tyrant has set in motion a process of national renewal.
But this process still has a long way to go.
The opposition has inherited a bankrupt country whose institutions are in ruins.
The population, frustrated by the deepening impoverishment and isolation, is beginning to question the events of the last decade in Serbia.
People are asking about the crimes committed by the Milosevic regime against the Serbs.
They must begin to address the crimes committed against others - in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo.
Once this process is under way, many problems that now seem insoluble will be easier to resolve.
Kostunica's election as President of Yugoslavia amounts to an incomplete revolution: many of the old guard are still in office.
The momentum created by the fall of Milosevic must be maintained.
Milosevic was overthrown in the hope of ending Serbia's isolation.
If the French Presidency fails to seize the moment in Zagreb, an historic opportunity will be lost.
A Czech moment
PRAGUE - Listening to what some Europeans said as my country prepared to assume the presidency of the European Union, I heard a faint echo of Neville Chamberlain's infamous description of Czechoslovakia as "a distant country of which we know little." I suspect that Donald Rumsfeld's misguided attempt a few years ago to create a split between "new and old" Europe contributed to the resurgence of this contemptuous attitude.
In reality, there is no old and no new Europe, and there never was.
The break with communism and the reunification of Europe are now almost two decades old.
We Czechs are 100% European, and we were when the Iron Curtain separated us from democratic Europe.
Indeed, our pro-EU sentiments may be all the stronger because our membership of the Union, like our freedom, is so comparatively new.
So no one in Europe should fear that the Czech Republic has some nostalgic or idiosyncratic agenda that it wants to impose on the Union.
On the contrary, events have imposed an agenda on Europe from which we cannot escape and which will be necessary for solidarity and genuine Union.
The primary and most pressing problem facing us is the financial and economic crisis that surrounds the EU.
Unfortunately, conditions throughout the Union are likely to deteriorate before they start to improve.
The kind of social unrest seen recently in Greece could spread, because the downturn will disproportionately affect young people in Europe who are looking for work at a time when hard-pressed European companies have very few jobs to offer them.
It will once again be the Union's task to help turn despair into hope.
We Czechs know something about this, because the painful economic transformation we underwent in the 1990s taught us a lot about how the right policies can break the grip of hopelessness.
In order to contain the current financial and economic crisis, Europe will also need to continue the cooperation it has shown so far.
The very existence of our Union, and the euro in particular, has already helped to prevent the competitive devaluations and beggar-thy-neighbor policies that devastated Europe during the 1930s, the last time the continent faced such a brutal economic downturn.
But we cannot be complacent that the forces of national selfishness are being held in check.
So far, through coordinated stimulus packages, EU governments have stripped populists of their usual charge that the EU is indifferent to the fate of individuals.
More policy coordination will be needed to address the crisis and restore EU standards as soon as the storm clouds begin to dissipate.
Although it is true that the Stability and Growth Pact has become more flexible in these exceptional times, its rules have ensured a successful first decade for the euro.
These rules must ultimately be restored intact if Europe is to return to the path of sustainable growth, and a consensus must now be forged for this.
The second key challenge facing us during our European Presidency is that of Russia.
A new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) between the EU and the Russian Federation needs to be negotiated.
These negotiations should have started in earnest last year, but the war in Georgia has put them on hold.
These talks have now resumed, but the backdrop to the negotiations has changed dramatically.
Russia's economy is currently in a much worse state than that of EU members.
The collapse of global oil and gas prices has hurt Russia's budget, and a lack of investment in the country's energy sector over the years is now causing the decline in output that economists have long predicted.
So far, Russia has paid less attention to a new PCA than the EU, because two-thirds of Russia's exports to the Union are natural resources that bring in money even without the strict rules of a PCA.
However, given the drastic changes in economic conditions, it is now in Russia's national interest to reassure international markets that it is a reliable business location for which a new PCA would serve as an ideal signal.
Moreover, without a new PCA, individual European countries may find it necessary to seek even more bilateral agreements with Russia.
Indeed, many EU members are engaged in a race to see who will be Russia's closest friend in the Union.
But the bilateral agreements that have emerged from this race are sometimes at the expense of other EU members and can upset relations within the Union as a whole.
Only a rules-based EU framework can provide a solid basis for both bilateral and Union-wide relations with Russia.
Europe's greatest strength in foreign policy is not its commitment to rules-based multilateralism, important as it undoubtedly is, but its unity.
When the Georgian crisis erupted, Europe agreed on a unified position on Russia's withdrawal.
It is the task of the Czech Republic and the Swedish Presidency of the Council of the EU, which will follow ours, to maintain this unity as PCA negotiations progress.
In the 1990 "s, the US and Europe got it wrong when they treated Russia with benevolent neglect.
A Day for Planetary Justice
PRINCETON - What we are doing to the planet, to our children and grandchildren, and to the poor through our reckless production of greenhouse gases is one of the great moral injustices of our time.
On 24 October, you can stand up against this injustice.
October 24 is the 350th anniversary.
The name derives from the number of parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that, according to Jim Hansen, perhaps the world's leading climate scientist, we should not exceed if we are to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change.
It is a measure of the seriousness of our problem that CO2 is already 386 parts per million and rising by two parts per million every year.
The need to reduce greenhouse gases is becoming increasingly evident, as global warming forecasts, denounced as "alarmist" only a few years ago, have repeatedly proved too conservative.
We are approaching a point of no return where feedback loops occur and the planet continues to warm, no matter what we do.
The melting of Arctic ice is one example.
Four hundred years ago, researchers searched for the legendary Northeast Passage via northern Europe and Russia to China.
They found the Arctic ice impenetrable and soon abandoned their search.
This year, merchant ships have successfully navigated the Northeast Passage.
This is one of many dramatic recent signs that our climate is changing and that our planet is warmer than it has been for a very long time.
But ice-free Arctic waters are more than a symptom of global warming.
They themselves are a cause of further warming: ice and snow reflect the sun's rays.
An ice-free surface absorbs more heat from the sun than one covered in snow or ice.
In other words, by causing enough warming to melt Arctic ice, our greenhouse gas emissions have created a feedback loop that will produce more warming and melt more ice, even if we stopped emitting all greenhouse gases tomorrow.
Other feedback loops pose a similar threat.
In Siberia, huge amounts of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas, are stored in so-called permafrost areas, where the soil was thought to be permanently frozen.
But areas that were previously frozen are now thawing, releasing methane, contributing to further warming and thawing, which releases more methane.
Developing countries understand how outrageous the current distribution of greenhouse gas emissions really is.
At the United Nations Climate Change Summit in September, Rwandan President Paul Kagame pointed out that, while developed countries outside Africa are almost entirely responsible for the problem, its biggest impact is likely to be on Africa, which has few resources to meet the challenge.
Kagame then proposed giving each country an annual per capita quota for CO2 emissions and allowing developing countries below the quota to swap their surplus quotas with countries above their quota.
The money that developing countries would get in return would not be aid, but rather recognition that rich nations must pay for something they have simply appropriated in the past: far more than their fair share of our atmosphere's ability to absorb our exhaust gases. Sri Lanka took a similar stance, calculating, citing studies by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that ecologically permissible carbon dioxide emissions amounted to no more than 2,172 kilograms per person in 2008.
In fact, global per capita emissions were 4700 kilograms, more than twice the legal limit.
But while emissions in rich countries were well above the permitted limit, Sri Lanka's emissions, at 660 kilograms, were significantly lower.
The Sri Lankan Government pointed out that low-emission countries like us could no longer emit because our space had already been exploited without our consent by developed countries or global, heavily polluting countries.
This situation is an injustice of enormous proportions, reminiscent of the now rejected colonialism of the Western powers in the nineteenth century and arguably even worse.
Its elimination must begin at the climate summit in Copenhagen in December.
Many political leaders have expressed support for decisive action on climate change, but what most of them see as "decisive action" will not be enough to bring us back below 350 ppm.
In some countries, including the United States, there are major political obstacles to taking even modest steps.
On 24 October, people in almost all countries will take action to raise awareness of the need for an international treaty to bring our atmosphere back to 350 ppm CO2.
In the Himalayas, where glaciers are melting, climbers will hang banners, divers on Australia's climate-threatened Great Barrier Reef will ring churches 350 times, 350 cyclists will circle cities and 350 trees will be planted in many places.
At www.350.org you can find out what is happening in your area and join in, or put your own idea online.
But don't just sit back and hope that others do enough to make a difference.
A Day of Liberation
When I was seven years old, in 1960, my grandmother Angelica opened my eyes to the significance of May 8, 1945, the day Nazi Germany capitulated and World War II ended in Europe.
We spent our summer holidays in Normandy, where the liberation of Europe from National Socialism had begun on 6 June 1944.
One evening, I listened to my parents and grandmother talk about the past.
I forgot the details of their conversation, but I can still hear my grandmother's sigh when she said, "Thank God we lost that war!"
From a child's perspective, it was not self-evident that losing was a good thing.
But, of course, my grandmother was right when she equated defeat with liberation.
The more I thought about the lesson she taught me 45 years ago, the more I realized another, less obvious dimension in her words: we lost the war.
Collectively, the Germans had not been the innocent victims of a small band of criminal outsiders called "Nazis," Nazism was an internal ideology supported by millions of Germans, and every German was liable for his or her atrocities, whether or not he or she had followed it individually.
In Germany today, an overwhelming majority subscribes to the thesis that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation not only for Europe, but also for Germany itself.
Compared to public opinion in 1960, this is certainly a huge step forward.
Paradoxically, however, it can also contain an element of forgetfulness, because it tends to obscure the fact that liberation required military defeat.
In the words of my grandmother, it was not we who were the liberators, but they.
The way people see the past tells us more about their current attitudes than about the past itself.
This is what the term "remembrance policy" is meant to refer to.
And so it does not matter whether the relevant events took place 60 years ago (such as the Second World War), 90 years ago (such as the Armenian genocide) or even 600 years ago (such as the Battle of Kosovo in 1389).
A violent conflict in the past may survive as a war of memories in the present, as can be seen in the current dispute between China and South Korea on the one hand, and Japan on the other.
A war of memories, in turn, can sometimes lead to violent conflict in the future.
Previous perpetrators often attempt to de-legitimize their former victims through moral superiority by claiming to have been victims themselves.
The 60th anniversary of the Allied fire bombing of Dresden on 13 February 1945 was therefore probably a more decisive moment for German commemoration policy than the 60th anniversary of 8 May 1945.
Far-right groups called the attack, which killed at least 30,000 people in Dresden, a bomb attack.
Fortunately, their propaganda campaign was a failure.
While it is true that thousands of civilians killed in Dresden and other German cities were innocent on an individual level, there can be no doubt that it was morally imperative to defeat Germany together.
On the left of the German political spectrum, the claim that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation remains unchallenged.
Sometimes, however, it is suppressed that the massive use of force was necessary to achieve this result.
Left-wing pacifism tends to overlook this simple fact.
Their slogan "Never again war!" is only half the truth, the other half is "Never again appeasement!" 8 May 1945 was not "zero hour," as it is often called in Germany.
It had a history, namely a lack of preventive resistance at home and abroad to the threat that built up in Nazi Germany in the 1930s.
There is another lesson to be learned.
Yes, 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation to which the Soviet army made a decisive contribution.
But the liberation of millions of Central and Eastern Europeans was followed by Stalin's oppressive regime.
The current war of memories between the Baltic republics and Russia in view of the international celebrations in Moscow on 9 May this year reminds Germany of a special historical responsibility.
The German-Soviet non-aggression treaty concluded in August 1939, the so-called Hitler-Stalin Pact, was supplemented by a secret annex dividing the border states of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania into spheres of interest of the two parties.
But excusing Nazi atrocities by pointing to Stalinist crimes is an intellectually and morally unacceptable ruse.
When Chancellor Schröder travels to Moscow for the Red Square celebrations, he should consider Nazi Germany's contribution to the Baltic tragedy.
On 8 May this year, public speakers will remind us how important it is not to forget this.
They will stress that if the lessons of history are not learned, history will inevitably repeat itself.
All this is absolutely correct.
But I personally will also remember my grandmother's phrase: "Thank God we lost this war!" Thank God and thanks to all the brave Allied soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the freedom of Europe.
A deglobalised world?
Cambridge - It may take a few months or a few years, but one way or another, the United States and other advanced economies will eventually recover from the current crisis.
But the global economy is unlikely to look like this.
Even when the worst of the crisis is over, we are likely to find ourselves in a somewhat de-globalized world, in which international trade is growing more slowly, foreign financing is reduced, and rich countries "appetite for large current-account deficits is diminishing significantly.
Will this spell doom for developing countries?
Not necessarily.
Growth in developing countries tends to consist of three different variants.
First comes growth, fueled by foreign borrowing.
Second, growth is a by-product of commodity booms.
Third, growth is led by economic restructuring and diversification into new products.
The first two models are at greater risk than the third.
But we should not lose sleep over them because they are flawed and ultimately unsustainable.
Of greater concern should be the potential plight of the countries in the last group.
These countries need to fundamentally change their policies to adapt to today's new realities.
The first two growth models inevitably come to a bad end.
Foreign credit can allow consumers and governments to live beyond their means for a while, but reliance on foreign capital is an unwise strategy.
The problem is not only that foreign capital flows can easily reverse direction, but also that they generate the wrong kind of growth, based on overvalued currencies and investment in untraded goods and services, such as real estate and construction.
Growth driven by high commodity prices is also vulnerable to collapse for similar reasons.
Commodity prices tend to move cyclically.
When they are high, they tend to crowd out investment in manufactured goods and other non-traditional commodities.
Moreover, commodity booms often lead to ugly politics in countries with weak institutions, resulting in costly battles over commodity rents that are rarely invested wisely.
Not surprisingly, the countries that have produced steady, long-term growth over the past six decades are those that have embraced a different strategy: promoting diversification into manufactured goods and other "modern" goods.
By capturing a growing share of world markets for manufactured goods and other non-primary products, these countries have increased their domestic employment opportunities in highly productive activities.
Their governments pursued not only good "fundamentals" (such as macroeconomic stability and outward orientation), but also what might be called "productivist" policies: undervalued currencies, industrial policies, and financial controls.
China is an example of this approach.
Its growth has been fueled by an exceptionally rapid structural shift toward an increasingly sophisticated group of industrial goods.
In recent years, China has also run a large trade surplus with the US, the counterpart to its undervalued currency.
But it wasn't just China.
Countries that had grown rapidly in the run-up to the Great Crash of 2008 typically ran trade surpluses (or very small deficits).
These countries did not want to be recipients of capital inflows, because they recognized that this would have devastating consequences for their need to maintain competitive currencies.
It is now accepted that large external balances, characterized by bilateral trade relations between the US and China, played an important role in the Great Crash.
Global macroeconomic stability requires that we avoid such large current account imbalances in the future.
But a return to high growth in developing countries will require them to resume their efforts to produce tradable goods and services.
In the past, the US and some other advanced countries have accommodated this push by running large trade deficits.
This is no longer a viable strategy for developing countries with large or middle incomes.
So are the demands of global macroeconomic stability and growth on developing countries contradictory?
Do developing countries need to create a wide range of industrial products that inevitably collide with the world's intolerance of trade imbalances?
Indeed, there is no inherent conflict if we understand that the size of their trade surpluses, not even the volume of their exports, is not important for growth in developing countries.
What matters is their production of modern manufactured goods (and services), which can expand indefinitely as long as domestic demand grows simultaneously.
Maintaining an undervalued currency has the advantage of subsidizing the production of such goods, but it also has the disadvantage of taxing domestic consumption, which is why it generates a trade surplus.
By directly promoting industrial production, it is possible to have the advantages without the disadvantages.
There are many ways to achieve this, including reducing the cost of domestic inputs and services through targeted investment in infrastructure.
An explicit industrial policy can be an even more effective instrument.
The key point is that developing countries, worried about the competitiveness of their modern sectors, can afford to allow their currencies to appreciate (in real terms) as long as they have access to alternative policies that encourage industrial activity more directly.
So the good news is that developing countries can continue to grow fast, even as world trade slows and appetite for capital flows and trade imbalances wanes.
Their growth potential need not be seriously affected as long as the impact of this new world on national and international politics is understood.
One of these implications is that developing countries must replace real industrial policies with those that operate via the exchange rate.
Another is that external policy actors (such as the World Trade Organization) must be more tolerant of this policy, as long as the impact on trade balances is neutralized by appropriate adjustments in the real exchange rate.
A decade of Hugo Chávez
SAN JOSE < unk > We should have known something was wrong when President Hugo Chávez < unk > swore in Venezuela's 40-year-old constitution on February 2, 1999, declaring it "moribund."
Under the "moribund," as the constitution was called, Venezuela saw not only eight peaceful presidential transitions, but also the fruits of democratic pluralism and strong civil and political freedoms.
Of course, Venezuela produced as much corruption and political irresponsibility during that time as it did barrels of oil. Nonetheless, Venezuela fared far better than the average Latin American country.
It was not Switzerland, but, by anyone's standards, a true democracy.
Not any more.
Elections are still taking place, but the legacy of Chávez's ten years in power is, first and foremost, the destruction of democratic institutions.
Elected in a landslide victory to remove the previous establishment's political vices, Chávez decided to throw the baby out with the bathwater.
The previous regime, including its system of separation of powers and tradition of political tolerance, disappeared, but its vices - especially its graft and demagoguery - became worse than ever.
Similar to 10 years ago, Venezuela, once a destination for immigrants from around the world, remains underdeveloped.
More fundamentally, Chávez espouses ideas that have long stifled Latin America's political and economic growth.
This includes the idea that social justice can only be achieved by abandoning the path of reform and rejecting bourgeois-democratic forms in favor of a "genuine" democracy that emerges from the leader's revolutionary purity and millennial dreams.
This is simply wrong.
Although the Chávez revolution has made progress in combating poverty and inequality, it is hardly sustainable and smacks of paternalism.
Indeed, similar achievements can be found in Chile and Brazil, which have not abandoned democratic checks and balances, political pluralism, or press freedom, and have not enjoyed the luxury of $300 billion in oil revenues in a decade.
Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that between 1950 and 1980 Venezuela itself reduced extreme poverty from 43% to 8% of the population, one of the lowest figures in Latin America.
And with democracy and freedom.
Chávez also repeats ad nauseam the notion that others are to blame for Latin America's ills.
This is the pernicious victim narrative that remains popular in universities across Latin America, and that the late Venezuelan journalist Carlos Rangel eloquently refutes in books like The Ideology of the Third World.
It is obvious that Yankee imperialism cannot be blamed for Venezuela's emaciated tax system, dismally poor schools, rampant corruption, high crime rates, and weak political institutions.
In all these areas, Venezuela itself performs poorly compared to Latin America.
This is particularly true of institutional weakness.
When Chávez declares a "moribund" constitution lawful, or when he proclaims l'état c'est moi by declaring a national holiday to commemorate his 10 years in power, we see eloquent examples of a homemade institutional farce that would condemn any country to the ninth circle of misery.
Of course, none of these ideas would resonate in a satisfied nation.
In this sense, Venezuela's experience speaks for all of Latin America.
The combination of economic growth (now reversed by the global crisis) and terrible levels of inequality and social segmentation will continue to fuel the same unfulfilled expectations and social resentments that paved Chávez's way to power.
Until Latin American democracies take seriously the challenges of reducing inequality, distributing opportunities, and promoting greater cohesion in societies, they will continue to fight for mischief.
In order to avoid this outcome, it is essential to eliminate certain reactionary and numbing beliefs, including the idea that poverty reduction eliminates the need to combat inequality or that development is possible without introducing modern and progressive tax systems.
If the tenth anniversary of Chávez's tenth term can serve as a reminder of the dangers that unjust democracies face - especially now that a new electoral cycle is looming in Latin America - then Venezuela's agonizing recent history would at least be redeemed.
A Declaration of Independence from the USA
George W. Bush is obsessed with the war on terrorism, especially the military response to terrorism.
American foreign policy reflects this obsession.
This year, the US will spend about $450 billion on the military, including the cost of the Iraq war, while it will spend no more than $15 billion to overcome global poverty, global environmental degradation, and global diseases.
In other words, US foreign policy spending is thirty times more focused on the military than on building global prosperity, global public health, and a sustainable environment.
Throughout 2003, the world lived with Bush's obsession.
The debate over Iraq dominated international diplomacy, occupying almost the entire UN agenda.
The war in Iraq cost countless innocent lives, such as when the UN headquarters in Baghdad was bombed.
At the same time, Bush's emphasis on a one-dimensional, militarized approach to global problems has fueled unrest and instability throughout the Islamic world, leading to increased terrorism in Turkey, North Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Southeast Asia.
The nature of suffering around the world hardly justifies this blinkered strategy.
Focusing on terrorism to the exclusion of other issues and emphasizing the military response to it will not bring prosperity and peace, nor will it significantly reduce the number of attacks.
While 3,000 innocent people died in the US on September 11, 2001, 8,000 innocent children die of malaria every day in Africa.
But malaria is preventable and treatable.
The problem is that most of Africa is too poor to mobilize the methods of prevention (bed nets) and treatment (malaria drugs) that could save millions of children every year.
The US spends more on Iraq every day than it does on Africa's malaria in a year.
As 2003 draws to a close, it is time for world leaders to help overcome the American government's obsessive, failing approach.
President Bush should be made to understand that if America keeps talking about terrorism but does almost nothing about the problems that really affect most of the world: poverty, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, vulnerability to disease, and climate change, the US will not find real international support.
Ironically, President Bush claims that the UN is not living up to its word.
In London recently, he declared that "the credibility of the UN depends on a willingness to keep its word and act when action is needed."
But the US repeatedly violates its own UN commitments.
For example, in March 2002, at the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico, the US signed the Monterrey Consensus, which included a promise by rich countries to increase their development assistance to 0.7% of national income.
This would bring the US an additional $60 billion a year in foreign aid - roughly what it spent on Iraq this year.
But President Bush simply ignored that promise.
There are many other similar commitments that the US has made to the United Nations in recent years that remain completely unfulfilled.
As a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in 1992, the US promised action to combat man-made climate change.
So far, it has been idle.
America also promised in the Doha Declaration in 2001 to open its markets to the world's poorest countries.
But in Cancun, Mexico, this summer, it refused to open its markets even to exports from struggling African economies.
The list goes on.
At the Millennium Assembly in 2000, the US promised to reduce global poverty, but it has taken few steps in that direction.
At the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002, America pledged to protect global ecosystems, but since then, little has been seen or heard from US policymakers on the issue.
America is certainly not the only country failing to promote the international goals adopted at the UN.
But, because the US is the richest and most powerful country in the world, its neglect is devastating.
If the US really wants to undermine terrorism, it must acknowledge the interconnectedness of extremism, poverty, and environmental degradation, and understand the struggles for survival that are underway among the poor everywhere.
But the world should not wait for America to come to its senses.
The US represents only 5% of the world's population and only one vote out of 191 countries in the UN General Assembly.
Poor countries, especially the democracies of developing countries - Brazil, South Africa, India, Mexico, Ghana, the Philippines - should say: "We must act on the issues that concern us, and not only on the issues that concern the US."
What the world needs most in 2004 is a declaration of independence from American arbitrariness.
A democratic Burma?
TOKYO - Historical transformations often occur when they are least expected.
Mikhail Gorbachev's liberalizing policy of glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union emerged in one of the darkest hours of the Cold War, when US President Ronald Reagan pushed for strategic missile defense and both sides fought proxy wars in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
Deng Xiaoping's economic opening followed China's bloody and failed invasion of Vietnam in 1978.
And South Africa's last apartheid leader, F. W. de Klerk, was initially perceived as just another apologist for the system - hardly the man to liberate Nelson Mandela and oversee the end of white-minority rule.
Now the world is suddenly wondering whether Burma (Myanmar), after six decades of military dictatorship, has embarked on a genuine political transition that could end the country's pariah status.
Is Burma, like South Africa under de Klerk, really emerging from half a century of self-imposed isolation?
And can Aung San Suu Kyi, the heroic opposition leader, and Thein Sein, Burma's new president, manage a political transition as skilfully and peacefully as Mandela and de Klerk did for South Africa in the early 1990 "s?
Despite her two decades of house arrest and isolation, Suu Kyi possesses two of the gifts that enabled Mandela to accomplish his great task: a calming composure and a complete lack of vindictiveness.
As Burma's authorities test reforms, these gifts, along with their negotiating skills and, above all, their enormous moral authority, are being tested like never before.
Moreover, unlike Mandela during his 27 years in prison, Suu Kyi has had her hopes raised and dashed before.
Reconciliation between Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) and the military junta seemed imminent in the mid-1990s and again in 2002-2003.
In both cases, however, the regime's hardliners prevailed and destroyed prospects for reform.
But Suu Kyi and much of the Burmese opposition are beginning to acknowledge that today's political liberalization may be the right thing to do.
With Burma's generals saying almost nothing in public, it is difficult to understand why they allowed elections that brought Thein Sein to power, or to explain their willingness to engage in dialogue with the long-repressed opposition.
Recent events suggest a possible explanation: Burma's rulers have become suspicious of China's near-suffocating embrace as a result of the country's international isolation.
Indeed, public protests against China's commercial exploitation of Burma's natural resources were so widespread that the government halted construction of the huge and polluting Myitsone Dam on the Irrawaddy.
Thein Sein's decision to halt the project is clearly an important policy shift.
It is also a signal to the outside world that Burma's new government may be far more willing than any of its predecessors to follow both public pressure and international opinion, both of which vehemently opposed the construction of the dam.
Almost at the same time, Thein Sein sent even stronger signals that he was a very different Burmese government: he released political prisoners and invited Suu Kyi to meet him directly.
Indeed, Suu Kyi now enjoys far more freedom of movement than at any time since the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded 20 years ago, and the NLD has recently announced that it will nominate candidates in the upcoming by-elections to the country's newly created parliament.
If Suu Kyi is allowed to campaign freely for her own seat and improve the electoral prospects of her NLD colleagues, it will be clear that Thein Sein and his government are truly determined to bring their country out of the cold.
For both Suu Kyi and Thein Sein, each step from now on will have to be delicate and coordinated with the same care and consideration that Mandela and de Klerk have applied in bridging their differences and guiding their country out of isolation.
But the international community must also proceed with great caution.
While Thein Sein undoubtedly wants the myriad economic and political sanctions against Burma to be lifted quickly, it is too early to ease them across the board.
But the outside world should show that any clear move toward greater political openness deserves more international political and economic engagement.
The Japanese Investment Bank's decision to invest in port development in Burma, which is essential to opening up the economy, is a positive sign that the world will keep pace with Thein Sein.
And US President Barack Obama's decision to send Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to meet with Thein Sein in Burma is another clear sign that the world is ready to end the country's isolation.
ASEAN's recent decision to give Burma the chance to chair the organization in 2014 underscores its neighbors "desire for full participation in Asia's growing prosperity.
No one should rush to judgment yet, but Thein Sein's decisions are similar, at least until now, to those of South Africa's de Klerk when he launched his country's reform process.
Fortunately, Burma already has its own Nelson Mandela in Aung San Suu Kyi.
A democratic windfall for Turkey?
Turkey's apparent fall from grace with the US may turn out to be a blessing in disguise.
The Iraq war, and the tortured diplomacy that led to it, could help resolve Turkey's conflict between its "strategic alliance" with America and its drive to join the EU.
Last November's elections, which brought the Justice and Development Party (AKP) to power, were preceded by a dispute between members of the then-ruling coalition over the implementation of the reforms demanded by the EU.
Some liberal elements of this "secular" coalition withdrew from government and joined the Islamists to push the reforms through parliament.
After coming to power, AKP leaders, former Islamists who had reinvented themselves as "conservative democrats," engaged vigorously with the US, the EU, and the UN on issues from Cyprus to Iraq, from Kurdish language rights to other human rights issues within Turkey.
After suffering from the repressive practices of the "secular" Turkish state and recognizing the need to protect human rights on a broad front, the AKP proved to be a credible interlocutor with the West.
The US, preoccupied with the supposed specter of a "clash of civilizations" between Islam and the West, saw the AKP's modern, westernized face as an opportunity and urged the EU to admit Turkey.
Today, both "conservative democrats" and liberals support the adoption of all the reforms needed to join the EU, while opponents include extreme nationalists from both the left and the right, as well as some elements of the "secular" establishment.
Europeans could have tipped the balance decisively in favor of reformers by finally rewarding the efforts of the pro-EU Turks at last December's summit of EU leaders.
Instead, the EU made Turkey wait again, postponing formal negotiations that could take years to conclude in any case.
Europe's stubborn reluctance puts the Turks in a quandary.
The Americans want Turkey to become a full member of the EU - a longtime NATO member and close American ally - while Europeans complain about the domestic role of the Turkish military.
The paradox is that by maintaining a political distance, thereby limiting Turkey's options, Europe could ultimately strengthen Turkey's status as a US military outpost.
In any case, that was the situation before the war in Iraq.
Then, despite massive US pressure, the Turkish parliament unexpectedly rejected the government's proposal to allow US troops in Turkey to invade Turkish territory.
Turkey's refusal to allow the Americans access to military bases on its territory virtually ruled out a northern front in the war.
The Turkish government even attempted a regional initiative for a peaceful solution to the crisis, an effort that no current EU member would have contemplated.
Parliament's rejection of US troops strongly refutes suggestions that Turkey was primarily concerned with the size of the American aid package offered as an incentive to cooperate.
Proposals that characterized the vote as a revelation of the government's true "Islamic" character ignore the fact that the only opposition party in parliament, the Republican People's Party - founded by Ataturk and still fully "secular" - voted against the plan.
Other elements of Turkey's secular establishment, including the president and military leadership, either rejected the idea of war in Iraq, or were half-hearted at best.
The Turkish military initially remained silent on the issue, observing the civilian political process uncharacteristically closely.
By contrast, the military had previously publicly criticized the AKP's initiatives on Cyprus.
Their silence on Iraq reflects their concern about undesirable alternatives: either they support the US plan and risk promoting Kurdish moves toward an independent state, or they oppose the Americans and jeopardize a critical strategic relationship.
They chose to submit to civilian leadership and parliament, which, by rejecting the US plan, reflected overwhelming public sentiment against the war.
Only after the vote did the Joint Chiefs of Staff publicly endorse the original proposal to bring American troops into the country.
In fact, the supposedly Islamic party managed to negotiate skilfully with the relentless US, consult with the Turkish military and president, and share all information with the public and parliament.
Walking a fine line in a situation where there were essentially losers, the party leadership set out the stakes clearly and prudently, leaving the final decision to Parliament.
The result was a victory for Turkish democracy and internationally recognised.
After the US military intervention in Iraq, the tide may turn in a surprising way.
As America establishes itself in Iraq, Turkey's geopolitical military importance could diminish.
But America's stated goal of building a Muslim democracy in Iraq will only reinforce Turkey's symbolic role model.
This shift in Turkey's strategic role could also be reflected in a new domestic balance between the military and the forces pushing for reform.
With careful management, Turkey could move closer to Europe, while rebuilding its relationship with America.
A Devaluation Option for Southern Europe
CAMBRIDGE - This year is likely to be an ordeal for the euro.
The eurozone's survival requires a credible solution to its long-standing sovereign-debt crisis, which in turn requires addressing the two macroeconomic imbalances - external and fiscal - that lie at the heart of that crisis.
The crisis has exposed the deep differences in competitiveness that have developed within the eurozone.
Unit labour costs rose by only 8% in Germany and 13% in France between 1996 and 2010.
Compare this to 24% in Portugal, 35% in Spain, 37% in Italy and a whopping 59% in Greece.
The result was large trade imbalances among eurozone countries, a problem exacerbated by large budget deficits and high public debt in southern Europe (and France), largely owed to foreign creditors.
Does addressing these imbalances require a break-up of the eurozone?
Let us assume, for example, that Portugal leaves the escudo and reintroduces it.
The ensuing exchange-rate depreciation would immediately make Portugal's exports more expensive, raise its import prices, boost the economy, and provide much-needed growth.
But leaving the euro would be a messy affair.
The resulting turmoil may well trump any short-term gain in competitiveness through devaluation.
There is a remarkably simple alternative that does not require troubled southern European economies to abandon the euro and devalue their exchange rates.
This includes an increase in value-added tax and a reduction in income tax.
Our recent research shows that such a "fiscal devaluation" has very similar effects on the economy in terms of its impact on GDP, consumption, employment, and inflation.
Currency devaluation works by making imports more expensive and exports cheaper.
A VAT-payroll swap would do exactly the same.
Increasing VAT makes imported goods more expensive, as foreign firms face higher taxes.
In order to ensure that domestic companies have no incentive to raise prices, an increase in VAT must go hand in hand with a reduction in payroll taxes.
Moreover, because exports are exempt from VAT, prices for domestic exports will fall.
The desired competitiveness effects of exchange-rate depreciation can thus be achieved while remaining in the euro.
This policy can also help on the fiscal front.
As with exchange-rate depreciation, the positive effects of increasing competitiveness on growth can strengthen the budgetary position through higher tax revenues.
Another important advantage of fiscal depreciation is that it generates additional revenue relative to the country's trade deficit.
For countries that suffer from weak competitiveness and, as a result, run trade deficits, this typically means more revenue, especially in the short term.
Like exchange-rate devaluations, fiscal devaluations create winners and losers.
Both act like a levy on assets: inflation means that bondholders suffer a real loss relative to their assets and the extent of the depreciation.
If capital taxes are not adjusted, holders of domestic shares suffer a comparable loss.
By contrast, many transfers, such as unemployment benefits, sickness benefits, and state pensions, are inflation-linked and thus retain their real value.
The same applies to minimum wages.
These distributional effects play an important role in the policy of exchange-rate devaluations, and most of these effects are reflected in fiscal devaluations.
A fiscal devaluation already has some advocates.
Indeed, French President Nicolas Sarkozy's government has just announced one.
And concerns that a fiscal devaluation might conflict with the euro's rules can be addressed simply by pointing out that the German government did one in 2007, albeit under a different name, when it raised value-added tax from 16% to 19% and lowered employers "contributions to social security from 6.5% to 4.2%.
In short, there are simple fiscal alternatives to exchange-rate depreciation that can solve southern Europe's short-term competitive problems.
Of course, realizable fiscal devaluations would be limited in scope.
But, together with debt restructuring, loose monetary policy, liquidity support from the European Central Bank, and much-needed structural reforms, they can help put these troubled economies on a solid footing without the euro breaking up or a major austerity-induced recession.
Cloudy light on global warming
COPENHAGEN - Amid a growing wave of concern about climate change, many countries - including Brazil, Australia, the United States, and members of the European Union - passed laws in the 2000 "s banning or severely restricting access to light bulbs.
The intention was understandable: if everyone in the world swapped most incandescent bulbs for energy-efficient compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), we could save 3.5% of total electricity, or 1% of our CO2 emissions.
The recent attempt by Republicans in the US Congress to reverse America's efforts to ban light bulbs has revived that debate.
Many claim that the agenda is being pushed by hand-wringing climate change deniers.
But it is worth taking a closer look at the premise that bans are the smartest way to address global warming.
Let us be clear: we must tackle climate change.
But that does not mean that we should simply reduce all emissions.
The benefits of burning fossil fuels are also considerable, and we should weigh these benefits against the costs.
A carbon tax should match the damage.
The best estimate is about $7 / ton of CO2 or $0.06 / gallon of gasoline (0.015 €/ liter).
Most developed countries already have a tax of this magnitude (and often much higher) on electricity and fossil fuels, though it also includes the costs of air pollution and security of supply.
While CFLs are more expensive to buy, they are much cheaper over their lifetime, because they consume much less energy (even more if carbon costs are included in electricity taxes).
On a simple cost-benefit basis, therefore, it seems reasonable for most people to switch from light bulbs to new, greener technology.
That's the great thing about technological solutions to climate change: when an alternative is cheaper, people will start using it.
My household uses CFLs, and I enjoy knowing that I emit less CO2 and spend less money.
Why, then, is it necessary to ban the old light bulbs at all?
The reason is that monetary costs are only one factor.
Many people find it annoying that CFLs need time to warm up.
Or they think their light is "funny."
Or they worry that light bulbs can spread toxic mercury if they break down.
In some people, energy-saving bulbs can trigger epileptic seizures and migraines.
The upfront costs are also a factor, especially for people on a small budget.
And in places where bulbs are not widely used, a cheaper light bulb can cost less overall than the energy-efficient alternative.
One could imagine that people could choose the right light bulbs for themselves.
But advocates of phasing out access to light bulbs argue that they know better.
As US Energy Secretary Steven Chu recently put it, "We are depriving people of a choice that continues to allow them to waste their own money."
Apart from other possible objections to this view, there is the problem that it assumes that all light bulbs are worth less than $7 per tonne of CO2.
This clearly does not apply to those who suffer from migraines or epileptic seizures as a result of the new light bulbs, or to those who are seriously concerned about mercury, or to those who have other reasons for preferring light bulbs.
The solution should be to focus on improving technology, heating up lights more safely, brighter, faster, and saving more energy, so that more people replace their lights.
But it's not just light bulbs that politicians are trying to ban.
MEPs voted overwhelmingly in favour of banning terrace heating, which one MEP described as "a luxury the planet cannot afford."
Who decides when something is luxurious?
And where does that end?
Should we ban air conditioners or satellite TV boxes because some people find them luxurious?
Should we ban private cars wherever public transport is available to move us from A to B with less CO2 emissions?
It makes sense to include carbon costs (among many other factors) in the price paid to drive our cars or heat our terraces; but if the phase-out is slower than some lawmakers want, a ban is not the right solution.
There will be real reductions in CO2 emissions only if better technologies make it worthwhile for individuals and businesses to change their behavior.
CFLs and other advances can take us part of the way, but there are huge technological hurdles to overcome before fossil fuels generally become less attractive than greener alternatives.
Many policymakers are wrong about this.
Governments talk far too much about imposing a relatively high carbon tax on emissions, while focusing far too little on ensuring a meaningful increase in research and development to bring about necessary breakthroughs.
Restricting access to the "wrong" light bulbs or patio heating is ultimately not the way to go.
We will only solve global warming by ensuring that alternative technologies are better than our current options.
Then people around the world will choose to use them.
A doomsday scenario
As America debates whether or not to invade Iraq, fear is creeping into the debate that the country's economic recovery may stall, adding to concerns about the health of the global economy.
The consensus is that the gap between the growth potential of the US economy and its actual performance will remain large for some time to come.
Can the situation get any worse?
Yes, it can: much worse.
A number of worrying factors for the US economy have been around for a long time:
Huge trade deficits have persisted since Ronald Reagan's misguided tax cuts in 1981 transformed America from the world's largest creditor to the world's largest debtor.
Today, these deficits set new records month after month.
America's shockingly low savings rate.
When American wealth seemed to be growing year after year while the stock market was booming, this was understandable. Individual Americans were getting richer without savings, so why bother?
Today's savings rate, while up slightly, is still at the bottom of the global savings league tables.
Lax accounting standards.
The Arthur Anderson, Enron, and WorldCom scandals have not been plucked out of thin air, but originated in the mid-1990 "s, when the US Treasury actually intervened to stop attempts by the supposedly independent Accounting Council to improve matters.
Poor accounting contributed to the recent stock-market bubble; bad information led to stock prices that did not reflect underlying realities; and these, in turn, incentivized the excessive investment in telecommunications that caused today's excess capacity.
New ingredients have been added to this old brew, particularly the fastest change in a nation's fiscal position that the world has probably ever seen.
In a "now you see it, now you don't" that only a magician should love, the US budget surplus of $3 trillion in ten years (excluding Social Security) has been transformed into a gaping $2 trillion deficit in a matter of months.
Of course, there are excuses: the magnitude of the economic downturn was unpredictable, and increased counter-terrorism spending could not be predicted.
Excuses, excuses.
As the old saying goes, don't count your chicks before they hatch.
The Bush administration not only counted its chickens, but sold them on!
It was clear to anyone with decent eyesight that the rosy budget forecasts of two years ago were nonsense.
It was also clear that the Bush administration engaged in dishonest, Enron-like accounting in promoting its billions of dollars of tax cuts.
So if it's that bad now, how can it get worse?
Here's a plausible scenario.
To finance its trade deficit, America must borrow more than $1 billion a day abroad.
When America was the only safe haven for global investors, it was easy.
But America today seems less secure.
The combination of a lack of confidence in the US corporate balance sheet, a lack of confidence in America's economic governance (exacerbated by growing deficits), and America's soft economic fundamentals has damaged the US economy's reputation in the world.
When foreigners start withdrawing their money from a country they suspect, the dollar weakens.
As the dollar weakens, America appears even more uncertain, so a run on the door begins.
While a weak dollar may be good for exports, a falling dollar will be accompanied by stock market losses and greater loss of confidence.
Ultimately, even the all-powerful American consumer will be shaken, realizing that he is poorer today than he was three years ago, and that he would be better off putting money aside for retirement, especially given Bush's risky experiments with the Social Security system.
At that point, Americans will join the rush from their economies.
Why wouldn't they?
They are free to choose where to invest their money.
Europe's stock markets will begin to look like an attractive alternative.
But this scenario does not offer a happy ending for Europe.
A weakening US economy and the strengthening euro will dampen European exports.
The European Central Bank, fixated on inflation, will be slow to cut interest rates, and the European Stability Pact will make it impossible for fiscal policy to compensate for these weaknesses.
Europe will join America in a downturn, exacerbate America's decline, and start a global downward spiral.
I am not predicting that this will happen.
I hope that the Bush administration will take action to strengthen the US economy: a tax cut that makes little sense than it seemed to have a multi-trillion dollar surplus no longer makes any sense at all.
The Bush administration should acknowledge this, and redesign a tax program to strengthen the economy by getting the country to live within its means.
President Bush could even stabilize the economy and offer better unemployment benefits to provide the stimulus needed if the downturn continues.
America is strong, and the global economy is strong.
If the catastrophic events under consideration occur, a new global economy will emerge from the ashes at some point.
Downturns can never be completely prevented, of course, but we can reduce their frequency; we can flatten them; we can ensure that fewer people are injured and that those who are injured are better protected.
Unfortunately, we do less than we can to prevent worse and do less than we need to to protect ourselves from the consequences.
A double-dip recession for the US?
Last winter, America's central bank - the Federal Reserve - was busy patting itself on the back.
The Fed's rate cut to 1.75% per year seemed to have worked: the recession was over.
Despite sobering expectations about the effects of the high-tech revolution on productivity and profits, as well as the unrest caused by the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, American companies were believed to be investing on a large scale again soon, because borrowing at 1.75% was too good a deal to refuse.
By late spring, those expectations had dissipated with the collapse of Enron, WorldCom, and Arthur Andersen.
Suddenly, everyone doubted the integrity of American companies "balance sheets.
Suddenly, everyone saw how much America's system of corporate surveillance and control had deteriorated during the bubble of the 1990 "s.
The US stock market fell 15-20% below its winter level.
The gap between the interest rate at which the US government could borrow and the rate at which American companies could borrow was widening.
Suddenly, the Fed stopped congratulating itself: an interest rate of 1.75% might be the right rate to fuel a recovery when the Dow Jones stock index stands at 10,000, but not when the Dow Jones index stands at 8,500.
Throughout the summer, business investment news remained disappointing.
More and more analysts have spoken of the possibility of a "double dip" recession.
Yet the Federal Reserve remained passive throughout.
The short-term interest rates it controls did not move.
As recently as mid-August, the Fed hinted at a possible rate cut.
The informal and unofficial rationale that leaked out of the Fed for its inaction had two parts.
First, short-term interest rates were already so low that anyone would consider further cuts only temporary.
They would therefore have little impact on the longer-term interest rates that really drive business investment.
Second, short-term interest rates were so low that additional cuts would scare financial markets: if even the Fed felt that conditions warranted cuts, the argument goes, companies would respond not by increasing their investment, but by reducing it.
The Fed's verdict seemed to be that it was largely (if not entirely) powerless: it had done everything it could, and the levers of monetary policy were no longer strongly tied to determining the level of economic activity.
So, in 2002, the US joined Japan in what economists have called a liquidity trap for 65 years: a situation in which the short-term nominal interest rates controlled by the central bank are so low and so loosely linked to aggregate demand levels that further reductions in the fight against recession are ineffective.
America's situation was not unique: Japan had been in a liquidity trap since the mid-1990 "s.
But there have been no other examples since the Great Depression of the 1930 "s.
Whether America is really trapped in a liquidity trap is uncertain, but how long it will last is unknown.
But even if America is on the verge of a liquidity trap, and even if it soon moves away from its current state, this is a frightening situation.
When monetary policy is ineffective, the only lever the American government has to get its economy under control is fiscal policy: changes to the government's tax and spending plans to change the government's direct contribution to aggregate demand.
But the lesson of the decades since World War II is that the US government - with its complex, baroque, eighteenth-century organization - is incapable of changing policy fast enough to use fiscal policy effectively as a tool for managing the economy.
It simply takes too long for tax and spending changes to find their way through Congress and the bureaucracy.
An America caught in a liquidity trap is, quite simply, a country without effective instruments of macroeconomic governance.
Since World War II, there have been two periods in which policymakers - at least American policymakers - believed that they had solved the conundrum of the business cycle and learned how to manage a modern industrial or post-industrial economy.
The first was the Keynesian sign of confidence in demand management in the 1960 "s.
It was destroyed by Vietnam-era inflation and the oil-price shocks of the 1970 "s.
The second was the decade of successful stimulus management by Alan Greenspan's independent, apolitical, and technocratic Fed during the 1990 "s.
This second era now seems to have been as fleeting as the first.
Eighty years ago, John Maynard Keynes argued that governments must take responsibility for maintaining full employment and price stability - that the gold standard before World War I was not the golden age that people thought it was, and that its successes were the result of a happy combination of circumstances that are unlikely to be repeated.
Keynes was an optimist who believed that governments could learn to manage the business cycle.
He would be shocked to look at today's world: a Europe with stubbornly high unemployment, a Japan mired in a decade of near-stagnation, and now an America that lacks the policy tools to deal with more unexpected economic bad news.
A Dutch treat for Brazil?
Brazil's successful return to financial markets at the end of April and the strengthening of the local currency, the Real, showed that the election of President Luiz Inácio da Silva (Lula) did not lead to a collapse of foreign confidence.
But even the recent positive developments do not make structural economic reforms superfluous.
Lula recognises that progress in this area, including labour market reform, is crucial if Brazil is to grow sufficiently to continue its ambitious social agenda.
What will be crucial is how Lula, a former metal worker and founder of CUT, which also represents most automobile workers, deals with the unions.
The recent strikes by car workers at the plants of General Motors, Renault, Volvo and Ford in Brazil do not bode well.
Proposed Social Security and tax reforms, submitted to Congress in late April, appear to be adding to tensions.
Lula should look to Europe to find examples of how to achieve high growth rates and job creation while maintaining social protection.
Europe can also provide a roadmap for politicians determined to transform themselves from anti-market leftists into opposition to reform-minded statesmen in power.
Spain's Felipe González and Britain's Tony Blair both made the trip.
A better example could be Wim Kok, who resigned last year after eight years as Dutch Prime Minister.
Both Lula and Kok share the unusual distinction of becoming head of government after their time as union leaders.
After rising to the top of the largest Dutch trade union FNV, Kok found himself in a position with considerable influence over Dutch economic policy.
During his tenure as union leader in the late 1970 "s and early 1980" s, the Dutch economy experienced a prolonged malaise - stagnant growth, high unemployment, unaffordable interest rates, and low corporate profitability.
Large budget deficits crowded out private investment.
Holland's problems were mainly structural, although a cyclical economic downturn made matters worse.
By 1982, the situation had deteriorated to such an extent that the "social partners" in the Dutch tripartite system (government, business and trade unions) concluded that combating the crisis required a break with the past.
The defining moment came with that year's Wassenaar Agreement - a pact between employers and unions that was signed with the active support of the government.
The unions agreed to moderate wage demands and abandon wage indexation in exchange for shorter working hours and better prospects for the future.
The increased flexibility of the Dutch labour market eventually restored the profitability of the private sector and led to rapid job creation, among the highest in Europe and comparable to that in the United States.
A prudent fiscal policy, pursued while the economy recovered and interest rates fell, created scope for large tax and social cuts.
Lower inflation boosted workers "real disposable income, allowing union leaders to show their members that wage restraint works and is in their interest.
The recent, much weaker performance of the Dutch economy can largely be explained by hefty wage increases, which have undermined competitiveness and contributed to job losses.
This prompted Kok to call last year - on the 20th anniversary of the Wassenaar Agreement - for a new pact between the country's social partners.
He will soon have a Europe-wide platform to deliver his message of wage moderation and labour market flexibility through his mandate to breathe new life into the EU Employment Strategy.
How relevant is the Wassenaar model for Brazil?
Unlike Holland in the early 1980 "s, Brazil's economy today faces the challenge of stimulating rapid employment growth amid fiscal constraints and high interest rates.
Although Brazil's registered unemployment rate is not very high by regional standards, its fast-growing labor force requires a high employment rate.
Copying the Dutch experience of job creation is the surest way to alleviate poverty in Brazil.
The idea is not that Brazil should seek to implement the Dutch socio-economic model - countries are too different for that.
But Lula can and should follow Kok's example, using his trade-union connections and working-class connections to achieve a social pact aimed at sustainably improving Brazil's overall economic performance and realizing its potential to become Latin America's economic powerhouse.
Brazil has benefited from an improvement in market sentiment and financial indicators since Lula's election.
Now his government should promote a Wassenaar-style guarantee of social peace.
This would give authorities leeway to address the country's huge longer-term policy objectives - including comprehensive reform of the costly pension system, an overhaul of the tax system, and strengthening the bankruptcy framework - that Brazil must face in order to become more competitive.
Lula's countrymen, who overwhelmingly elected him, need rapid economic growth and job creation.
This will only happen if Lula completes the successful transformation from an anti-market trade union leader to a statesman who intelligently combines economic and social reform.
Success would not only benefit Brazil, but would also have a strong demonstration effect throughout Latin America.
One Europe for All
Longstanding members of the European Union now seem to doubt the future of the Union, but we in Ukraine regard the European Union with hope and admiration.
Joining the progress of the EU is the fundamental objective of our foreign policy, because Ukraine has discovered that nationality is not an end, but a beginning.
Indeed, European unity is indivisible: when a nation is ostracized, not everyone is free.
We Europeans are caught in an inescapable web, bound in a single garment of fate.
Every aspect of our shared culture, if not the last century of shared suffering, confirms this for us.
Whatever concerns a European directly affects everyone indirectly.
We can never again afford to live with the narrow idea of two Europe, of the have-nots and the have-nots, of insiders and outsiders.
Those who live on the European continent cannot and must not be considered strangers in their Union.
Today's Great Pax Europe and today's pan-European prosperity depend on it.
Of course, some claim that Ukraine is not Europe.
Let them come to Kiev and talk to the people, young and old, factory workers, peasants, lawyers, doctors and teachers, who endured weeks of cold and snow last winter to defend their freedoms.
Are they not united with those who stood by General de Gaulle in the French Resistance?
Are they not one with those who died fighting for the Spanish Republic in the 1930s, liberated Budapest in 1956, and ended fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970s?
Are they not inspired by the same spirit as Poland's Solidarity and the peaceful masses that gave rise to the Prague Velvet Revolution in 1989?
That is the true European spirit, and no doubt it can crush it.
To those who say that Ukraine is too backward for EU membership, I say: let them come to my country too and see the mothers who stay at work late at night teaching their children to use their computers at work.
Let them come to language courses in every village and city where young people prepare for Europe by learning French, German and English. Those who doubt Ukraine's European vocation should understand that Europe is not a question of hardware and highways, but an insatiable desire for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.
I believe that our future is as promising as Europe's past is proud of, and that our destiny lies not as a forgotten borderland in a troubled region, but as creators and builders of peace and unity in Europe.
Self-determination no longer means isolation, for achieving national independence nowadays only means returning to the world stage with a new status.
New nations can build with their former occupiers the same kind of fruitful relationship that France has built with Germany - a relationship based on equality and mutual interests.
This is the kind of relationship that my government wants to have with Russia, and if we achieve it, we can help to extend the European zone of peace.
Of course, it is premature to do more than point out the high esteem we hold for the prospect of EU membership.
We know that our part in this great building will not be built overnight.
We know that the great works of European unification do not lie in documents and declarations, but in innovative measures to improve life and ensure the security of all Europeans.
Building a Ukraine worthy of EU membership will not be easy, cheap, or quick.
But like the Union itself, it will be built and it will happen.
We know that the challenge is great, but the price is worth the fight, and Europe should know that this is our objective.
Part of the work on Ukraine's renewal is a creative struggle to end a nightmarish century in which fascism and communism, ideologies born in the heart of Europe, fought for power.
Just a few months ago, our children and parents in cities across Ukraine faced armed troops, snarling dogs, and even death.
Only a few years ago, the young journalist Georgi Gongadze, who wanted to inform the public about the corruption of our old regime, was brutally treated and beheaded by the thugs of this regime.
But our Orange Revolution last winter shows that the Ukrainian people have prevailed.
Despite today's doubts and difficulties, I stand by my belief in Europe.
I refuse to accept despair as the last answer to the ambiguities and horrors of Ukrainian history.
I refuse to accept the view that Ukraine is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of the communist legacy that we will never see the bright day of peace and true European unity.
As EU citizens reflect on Ukraine's place in Europe, they should think outside the box and look more closely at the face they see.
They should look beyond the ravaged wastelands wrought by communism, beyond the poverty and social division through which our discarded former leaders sought to prolong their misrule.
Instead, they should look closely at the face of our President Viktor Yushchenko, poisoned during last year's election campaign, and recall the words of the great Frenchman André Malraux, for whom "the most beautiful faces are the wounded."
A Europe of provinces, not states
Now that the European Constitutional Convention is meeting to discuss the finer points of the European Union's future institutions, the time has come to think the unthinkable about where Europe is heading.
Or at least to consider an entirely different question: where would it be reasonable for the EU to move?
With the fall of communism, several small states emerged in Europe.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania returned from Soviet occupation.
Czechoslovakia split into two separate states.
Yugoslavia has given way to Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, and Macedonia; it may soon eat Kosovo and Montenegro, too.
Although the Baltic republics merely restored their independence before World War II, and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, like so many other wars of independence, was a bloody affair, there is also something seductive new in all this.
In the interwar years, the Baltic states were often seen as impractical, artificial creations of the great powers.
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia arose because their constituent parts were not considered viable independent states.
Why was that?
For 80 years ago, when Wilson, Clemenceau, and Lloyd George redrew the map of Europe, small states were dysfunctional in both wartime and peacetime.
To be viable, a state had to be large enough to defend itself and form a relatively independent economic market.
None of this is true today.
Given the prospect of EU accession, national markets play less of a role.
Both EU and NATO membership make war between European member states unthinkable, and even an attack on the smallest NATO member would provoke a reaction from all NATO members.
Without such external threats, the links between, say, the Czechs and Slovaks (not to mention Serbs and Croats!) are too weak to justify a common level of national government.
Does this tell us anything about the future of Europe as a whole?
The difference between Czechoslovakia and Italy or Germany is usually 50 years.
Wasn't Italy a collection of kingdoms and principalities until the 1860s?
Wasn't German unification a matter of "blood and iron"?
France and Spain are older, but is the marriage of Basques, Catalans and Corsicans with their nation states so much happier than the previous Czech-Slovak marriage?
Are there really so many reasons why the Scots and Welsh should be part of the same nation-state as the English?
Let us take for a second the idea of French, German or Italian identity, patriotism, the collective memories of war and carnage that cemented the consciousness of today's linguistic communities and think: why do Europeans need an intergovernmental level, between the common European framework and its local institutions?
Why do Piedmontese, Bavarians, or Scots need intergovernmental national bureaucracies to run their tax policies, welfare programs, securities laws, and the largely useless, duplicating armies?
Wouldn't life be easier if a common market, a common currency, foreign policy, an army and a few other things were run on a European basis and the rest left to more sensible local units?
It is fashionable to make fun of the bureaucratic minutiae of European regulation.
But European regulation is nothing compared to the mountains of national laws and regulations, the billions wasted on political patronage, and the colossal state machines that devour 30-40% of the economic product of European nation states.
Could a common European state be worse off?
Indeed, the creation of a European federal government and the elimination of national intermediaries would probably lead to the greatest liberalization of the economy (and of society as a whole) in the entire history of Europe.
Look at America in 1787: the creation of the federal government swept away the balkanized system of pre-revolutionary colonies and ushered in an era of entrepreneurial expansion across the American continent.
The simple fact is that Europe as a whole is too diverse to be hijacked by the economic and political interest groups that now dominate nation states.
Only as an additional layer of government does the EU appear burdensome and bureaucratic.
If it were to supplant national governments, its burden would be weightless compared to what exists today.
Nations are also upsetting Europe's constitutional balance.
Germany and Italy are simply too large compared to Portugal or Belgium (themselves a rather dubious amalgam of Flemish and Walloon populations), and this creates the kind of imbalances reminiscent of Prussia's heavy foot in the old Bismarck Empire.
Could a federal Europe replace today's national identities?
Could the French and British feel as at home in Europe as they do in their nation states?
No, but do they have to?
When Europeans think of future institutions, the tension is always seen as that between national differences and a common European identity.
But what if common European institutions are not viewed through the prism of national institutions?
What if the evolution of the European consciousness proceeds not through an upward transfer of attachment to supranational institutions, but through decentralisation of loyalties and the revitalisation of smaller, more significant communities?
Of course, the demise of nation-states is not imminent, but not because they are so deeply rooted in their citizens "consciousness.
In fact, national identities are mostly poorer abstractions, clichés like race, class, and other ideological creations.
Imagine how much more genuine diversity there would be in a united Europe if nation states were not squatting in the middle.
But Europe's nation-states will not disappear for a while, because they are centers of power.
After all, forty cents of every euro of GDP is a lot to argue about.
But if Europeans get a sense of where they should go, the national identities forged over the last few hundred years (for they are not much older) will, over time, become like the appendix - a part of the human body responsible for little more than occasional inflammation.
A women's Europe?
PARIS - Are women in Europe on the verge of becoming an engine of political change?
In economic development circles, experience and common sense suggest that progress, accountability, and hard work begin and depend on women.
Micro-credits, for example, are much more efficient when women receive them and pay them back.
Perhaps because they need to have children and find the means to feed them, women are now perceived as the best and most determined agents of change.
This seems to be as true today for European politics as it is for the economies of parts of Africa and Asia.
The results of Italy's recent municipal elections may signal an incipient electoral dynamic: it was women who voted Silvio Berlusconi's party out of office in Milan, a city he has long controlled (and where he was originally based).
There is no direct link between this result and the dramatic scandal involving Dominique Strauss-Kahn in New York, but immediately after DSK's arrest, Italian women and young voters mobilized decisively against Berlusconi's party (which, ironically, was led by a woman in Milan).
These voters could no longer tolerate the combination of machismo and vulgarity that had once served the man Italian humorists now call "Berlus-Kahn" so well.
When Berlusconi first came to power 17 years ago, he was supported by a majority of women.
They were not discouraged by his ambivalent perception (in which he alternately celebrated their traditional domesticity and glorified their sexual objectification).
But Italian society has changed: most women now work and are no longer willing to accept Belusconi's anachronistic and outrageous chauvinism.
Italian men may feel sorry for the ageing, isolated head of state, who increasingly looks like his waxwork at Madame Tussaud.
But Italian women (indeed, women everywhere, it seems) feel nothing but anger and humiliation at a man so obsessed with himself, his various criminal trials, and his vulgar pleasures that he seems to have no other purpose than to stay in power for as long as possible.
Women are not alone in rejecting Berlusconi, of course, but they made the difference in Milan.
They are the incarnation of modernity, animated by a longing for simple dignity and respect.
You are not alone at the head of a new Europe of women.
When Iceland went bankrupt because of the irresponsible behavior of its largely male political and financial elites, the Icelandic people decided that only a strong and responsible woman could solve the country's problems.
So they elected one as president.
The scale and severity of the current economic and social crisis in countries such as Greece, Portugal and Spain offer women a new opportunity.
Faced with what many of them perceive as the equivalent of "economic war," women are playing an increasingly important role in maintaining their families "financial security.
And the more this spreads, the more women will seek a political role that reflects their economic clout.
Of course, women's changing status cannot directly translate into growing political influence.
And the rest of Europe may never follow the example of Scandinavia, where gender equality is much more advanced than elsewhere.
But such a dynamic now seems to be under way.
Similarly, regardless of the outcome of the DSK trial in New York, the case could mark a turning point in the treatment of women in Europe.
It is to be hoped that public and private displays of atavistic machismo will no longer be considered acceptable.
In the Arab world, too, from Tunis to Cairo, young women have played an important role in the revolutionary process.
Their desire for change - understandable, given the treatment of women in traditional Muslim societies - seems to be one of the main causes of the power of the revolutionary impulse in Tunisia and Egypt.
None of this is to say that women are a universal force for positive change in Europe and around the world.
Consider Marine Le Pen, the new leader of the French National Front, Elena Ceaucescu, the dirty wife of the former Romanian dictator, or, more recently, Leila Trabelsi, the wife of Tunisian ex-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who fled to Dubai with 1.5 tons of gold looted from the central bank.
The point is simply that, with so many people in so many countries demanding far-reaching changes, gender policy plays a major role in Europe and beyond.
The most important question is whether the growing number of women in politics will provide the diverse perspectives and modes of leadership that many voters (or protesters) now seem to crave.
A European remedy for depression in the Balkans
VIENNA - European politics is largely shaped by events and anniversaries.
But while events are often unpredictable, anniversaries are not.
In five years' time, Europe will reflect on the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War, which led to almost unprecedented loss of life and a chain of events that led to the creation of Europe as we know it today.
Perhaps world leaders have already reserved a few days in August 2014 to mark the occasion.
It is easy to predict that Sarajevo will be the place where they will meet to look back on Europe's wild 20th century.
But what will Sarajevo look like in five years?
Will it still be the capital of a country whose citizens see a bleak future and whose politicians have completely lost touch with the electorate?
Or is there hope that European leaders will use the anniversary to announce the successful integration of the remaining Balkan countries into the European Union?
A recent Gallup Europe poll by the Balkan Monitor suggests public opinion in Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo, 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and a decade after the end of the Kosovo war.
The results seem to suggest that the next five years will be crucial for the future development of the region.
While the overwhelming majority of citizens are convinced that another armed conflict in the region is unlikely, the mood among the population - with the exception of Kosovars and Albanians - is pessimistic.
The future promises peace without development.
Trust in political elites and in national and European institutions is steadily declining.
The majority of citizens have experienced a decline in living standards in the last year, and the perception remains that people have more opportunities outside their own country.
Pessimism about employment is alarmingly high among young people, while government corruption and mismanagement are seen as widespread.
All those who have set themselves the task of praising stability in the region should look at these figures.
Indeed, it is striking that the majority of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina believe that their leaders have no interest in their country's accession to the EU.
An absolute majority of citizens in each of the countries surveyed are convinced that their country is heading in the wrong direction.
Fewer than one in ten Croats (whose country could join the EU in the near future) believe that their country is moving in the right direction.
There are now two options for the region: one is a "shock integration programme" involving all the countries of the Western Balkans in the EU; the other is a journey into the unknown.
The hope that these countries can muddle through on their own is a dangerous illusion.
Stability alone can no longer be the EU's sole objective in the region.
The continued presence of the EU as a colonial power in countries such as Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo could cause even more problems in the future, especially if there are no benefits.
In particular, delaying Serbia's integration into the EU could bring Tito-inspired fantasies to the heart of the country's foreign and security policy.
Thus, the demoralization of Balkan society creates its own dynamic when the best and brightest see their future outside their own country, and "stability" is just another name for political and economic stagnation.
If European leaders plan to meet in Sarajevo in 2014, they should act now.
The ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon allows for a bit of visionary realism in European policy, as no institutional obstacles stand in the way of future enlargement of the EU.
Unlike a year ago, we now know how many states are in the Balkans, and the results of the Balkan Monitor show that they all want to join the Union.
What the EU has learned from the results of the last parliamentary elections in Bulgaria is that, contrary to popular belief, Brussels "influence over the new member states increases rather than diminishes after accession.
The EU's decision to liberalise its visa regime for Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia, and the fact that Giorgos Papandreou, the main architect of the EU's Balkan integration strategy, is back in power in Greece, are further grounds for optimism.
But for the Balkans, this is now or never.
Visa liberalization may be a strategic step toward "shock integration," but if it is not followed by bold EU policies, it could become nothing more than a repackaging of the status quo.
In short, it is time to shape events rather than simply mark anniversaries.
Closing Europe's Policy Gap
MADRID - The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has been a hotly debated topic for nearly a year.
But one question has largely escaped scrutiny: what Russia's annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine say about the European Union's foreign policy.
In the early stages of the crisis, Germany, which had relied heavily on Russia's modernization, was reluctant to draw conclusions.
But, as the crisis deepened, German Chancellor Angela Merkel worked to convince her European counterparts to adopt a comprehensive and biting sanctions regime.
This was certainly a step in the right direction, but it did nothing to address the foreign-policy failures that triggered the crisis in Ukraine and further undermine Europe's response - namely, the EU's misguided Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and its confused approach to energy.
On both fronts, the EU's lack of strategic vision has given the impression that Russia's President Vladimir Putin is constantly outmaneuvering Europe.
It increasingly seems that Ukraine is engaged in a "frozen conflict," Russia's foreign-policy specialty.
Indeed, the situation in Ukraine represents a tactical victory for Russia, with the fragile but permanent ceasefire and accompanying laws granting Donetsk and Luhansk significant political autonomy and allowing Russia to anchor the conflict near the EU border.
In addition, the delayed implementation of key elements of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement is clear evidence that Russia is currently dictating the terms of EU-Ukraine engagement.
In Europe, the Kremlin has been able to pursue a successful divide-and-rule strategy, especially given Hungary's decision to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine.
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's government, whose behavior in recent years contradicted the EU's democratic criteria, now openly endorses authoritarian regimes - and Putin in particular - with serious potential consequences for European unity.
Nonetheless, the timing of the current ceasefire, which coincides with the creation of a new EU Commission, is beneficial, as is Putin's myopic emphasis on tactical victories.
EU leaders should use the pause in fighting to anticipate rather than react.
With a long-term strategic vision, the EU could overwhelm and ultimately undermine Putin's short-term successes.
Such a vision must include a new conception of the ENP.
The mission of the programme to manage the political, social and economic transition of the neighbouring countries is not inherently problematic; the problem lies in the way in which the mission has been interpreted and pursued.
For starters, the ENP assumes that all of the EU's neighbours, both to the south and east, ultimately want to implement European values and structures in their own countries.
In other words, the ENP does not take into account the development, cultural and emerging differences between EU partner countries.
Operationally, the ENP suffers from its overly technical approach and lack of strategic vision.
For example, before the Ukraine crisis, the European Commission was so focused on negotiating the technical features of the Association Agreement that it did not take sufficient account of the potential consequences of the process - such as a Russian response.
Naturally, the EU recognised the need for a coherent strategy and tried to resolve it by establishing the European External Action Service and the position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs.
But the EEAS ended in turf war with the European Commission, and outgoing High Representative Catherine Ashton did little to ease tensions, unwilling to interfere in internal EU disagreements.
It is significant that Ashton has made progress only in areas defined by broad consensus, such as the negotiations on Iran's nuclear programme and the pact between Kosovo and Serbia.
Europe's effectiveness is further undermined by its fragmented approach to energy security.
With each country largely controlling its own energy policy, Europe's energy market has become inefficient and excessively dependent on Russian supplies.
To the extent that there was an EU-wide energy strategy, it referred to renewable energies and not to the intersection of geopolitics and energy security.
But there is reason for hope.
The new Commission, which its President Jean Claude Juncker has significantly restructured, could provide Europe with the strategic leadership it so badly needs.
Indeed, Juncker has already expressed a desire to include the future High Representative Federica Mogherini in the Commission's political programme.
The new structure entrusted to Mogherini to lead and coordinate the work of several Commissioners, including those responsible for trade, ENP and climate and energy, should strengthen the coherence and direction of EU policies, especially after Mogherini has completed her assessment of the global strategic landscape mandated by the European Council.
But a restructured Commission is not enough to ensure a fresh start in Europe's foreign policy strategy.
This requires Mogherini to assert herself as a leader supported by Juncker and the new president of the European Council, Donald Tusk.
And, most importantly, all EU member states must recommit to cooperation.
The Ukrainian people have demonstrated the power of European values.
In fact, Europe has a large number of instruments; it just has to figure out how to use them.
If it can, it will be better able to respond not only to the Russian challenge, but also to many of the other challenges that characterize today's rapidly changing global environment.
A Failed Global Recovery
NEW HAVEN - The global economy is in the midst of its second growth shock in less than two years.
Get used to it.
In a post-crisis world, these are the traces of a failed recovery.
The reason is simple.
The typical business cycle has a natural damping mechanism that fends off unexpected shocks.
The deeper the downturn, the stronger the snapshot and the greater the cumulative forces of a self-sustaining revival.
Strong V-shaped rebounds have built-in resilience that allows them to resist shocks relatively easily.
But a post-crisis recovery is quite another matter.
As Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have shown in their book This Time Is Different, the post-crisis recovery in output and employment has tended to be well below average over a long period of history.
Such weak recoveries, by definition, lack the cushion of V-shaped rebounds.
As a result, external shocks quickly reveal their vulnerability.
If the shocks are strong enough to hit a weakened global economy approaching its "standstill pace" of about 3% annual growth, the relapse could turn into the dreaded double-dip recession.
That is the risk today.
The clearly below-average nature of the current global recovery is unmistakable.
On the surface, the figures look strong: world GDP rebounded by 5.1% in 2010 and is expected to increase by a further 4.3% in 2011, according to the International Monetary Fund.
But, because these gains follow the massive contraction during the Great Recession of 2008-2009, they are far from the course of a classic V-shaped recovery.
If the IMF's latest forecast proves correct, global GDP at the end of 2012 will still be about 2.2 percentage points below the level that would have been achieved if the world had remained on its longer-term annual growth path of 3.7%.
Even if the global economy continues to travel at a pace of 4.3%, I believe that this will be a major step forward if it remains below its trend potential for more than eight years in a row until 2015.
This persistent "global output gap" underscores the lack of a cushion in today's global economy, as well as its increased sensitivity to shocks.
And there have certainly been many such blows in recent months - from Europe's sovereign-debt crisis and the natural disasters in Japan to soaring oil prices and another setback to the US housing recovery.
While none of these shocks appears to have been severe enough to derail the current global recovery, the overall effect is worrying, especially in a post-crisis world still weakened.
Most experts rule out the possibility of a double-dip recession.
They call the current slowdown a temporary "soft patch," and link their optimism to the inevitable recovery that follows each shock.
Japan's reconstruction and the resumption of the supply chain, for example, are expected to provide a boost.
Further help could be America's latest move to tap its strategic oil reserves to drive down oil prices.
But, in the wake of the worst crisis and recession in modern times, in which shocks can tip an already weakened global economy to its tipping point much faster than a stronger growth scenario would, the escape velocity of a self-sustaining recovery is much more difficult to achieve.
The soft patch could be closer to a swamp.
This conclusion should not escape emerging economies, especially in Asia, now the world's fastest-growing region and leader of what many now call a two-speed world.
But, with exports still reaching a record 45% of national GDP, Asia can ill afford to take external shocks lightly, especially if they follow an already weakened post-crisis growth trajectory in advanced economies.
The recent slowdown in Chinese industrial activity underscores precisely this risk.
Policymakers are ill-prepared to deal with a steady stream of growth concerns.
They continue to prefer strategies that are better suited to combating crises than to promoting post-crisis healing.
That certainly applies to the United States.
While the US Federal Reserve's first round of quantitative easing was effective in ending a painful crisis, the second round did little to sustain a meaningful recovery in the labor market and the real economy.
America's zombie consumers need to repair their damaged balance sheets, and US workers need to balance new skills with new jobs.
Unlimited injections of liquidity do neither.
The European authorities are caught up in a similar mindset.
Because Europe regards a solvency problem as a liquidity gap, it depends on the drip of rescue packages.
But that will only work if countries like Greece escape the debt trap or abandon their deep-rooted social contracts.
The chances of both are extremely slim.
The likelihood of recurring growth fears in the coming years offers little hope for new and creative approaches to post-crisis monetary and fiscal policy.
Driven by short-term campaign promises, politicians are constantly looking for a quick fix for another bailout or injection of liquidity.
But, in the wake of a balance-sheet recession in the US and a debt trap in Europe, this approach is doomed to failure.
Liquidity injections and bailouts serve only one purpose: to buy time.
But time is not the answer for economies in dire need of structural repairs to fiscal consolidation, private-sector deleveraging, labor-market reforms, or improved competitiveness.
Nor does time cushion the anemic recovery from the inevitable post-crisis shock.
It is difficult to say when the next shock will occur or what form it will take, otherwise it would not be a shock.
But, as day follows night, such disruption is inevitable.
As policymakers hesitate to focus on the need for structural healing, the result will be yet another fear of growth or worse.
A failed recovery underscores the risks of an increasingly treacherous endgame in today's post-crisis world.
A fair deal for Turkey
Turkey has been given an ultimatum by the European Commission: open its ports to ships from Cyprus within a month, or risk halting the ongoing EU accession talks.
At the same time, the Commission's recent report on Turkey's progress towards accession notes that political reforms have slowed down, further calling into question the country's future EU membership.
The Commission's progress report will be discussed by the European Council next month.
At this meeting, European leaders should ask themselves the following questions: has the EU given Turkey a fair deal in the case of Cyprus?
Has the EU consistently supported political reforms in Turkey?
What are the EU's long-term interests towards Turkey?
If the answers to the first two questions are 'no', as I believe, the third question will be crucial.
It is true that Turkey has closed its ports to ships from (Greek) Cyprus, and that is in breach of agreements.
It is also true, however, that the northern Turkish part of Cyprus is denied access to free trade and other benefits from EU membership.
This is because Cyprus remains a divided island.
When Cyprus joined the EU in 2004, it was assumed that Cyprus should be united.
A United Nations unification plan was accepted by the Turkish side.
But Greek Cypriots voted against the plan because their leaders failed to honor the implicit agreement with the EU to support it.
Nevertheless, Cyprus became a member of the EU, but only the Greek part.
This was clearly a mistake, because it made the EU part of the conflict.
It allowed the Greek Cypriot leadership to block progress in negotiations between the EU and Turkey.
So how can Turkey maintain confidence in the fairness of the EU under these conditions?
Political and legal reforms in Turkey have been remarkably far-reaching in recent years, as they have clearly been driven by Turks "desire to move closer to the EU.
But public support for EU membership in Turkey has declined dramatically, as Turks increasingly feel that they are not being offered a fair deal.
This has given new strength to those who want Turkey to move in a different direction, towards a more Islamic society instead of a modern secular state.
The recent lack of progress in Turkey's reform process can therefore largely be explained by the EU's behaviour.
The third question remains: what kind of Turkey does the EU want?
There should be no doubt about the answer: it is clearly in the EU's interest to further strengthen democracy and the economy in Turkey.
More than 40 years ago, it was promised that once Turkey met the conditions for membership, it would be welcome in the EU.
It is high time that European leaders took this promise seriously.
It is a sad fact that a large majority of voters in the EU are opposed to Turkish membership.
But they are responding to the current situation.
When asked whether they want a reformed Turkey as a partner - a Turkey that fully meets the conditions for membership set out in the Copenhagen criteria (democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights, and an effective market economy) - many more tend to say yes.
European leaders must therefore face two challenges.
First, they should clearly tell their own voters that the EU must deliver on its promises to Turkey, and that this is in the greater interest of all Europeans.
Second, they should offer Turkey a fair deal in the negotiations.
The first litmus test for European leadership concerns the practical problem of access to ports.
Here the Finns, who currently hold the Presidency of the EU, have taken an initiative to implement a pragmatic solution that takes account of both sides in the conflict.
The Finnish initiative should be strongly supported by all European Heads of State or Government.
At the same time, a new attempt should be made to breathe life into the UN proposals on Cyprus.
If that means putting pressure on some players within the EU's own ranks, so be it.
A Fair Deal on Climate Change
The agreement on climate change reached by the G8 leaders in Heiligendamm merely sets the stage for the real debate to come: how will we share out the atmosphere's declining capacity to absorb our greenhouse gases?
G8 leaders agreed to pursue "substantial" reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and to seriously consider halving them by 2050 - an outcome hailed as a triumph by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
But the agreement commits no one to concrete goals, least of all the United States, whose President George W. Bush will be out of office in 2009, when the difficult decisions have to be made.
One might reasonably ask why anyone believes that such a vague agreement is progress at all.
At the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, 189 countries, including the United States, China, India and all European nations, signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, agreeing to stabilize greenhouse gases at low levels in order to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.
Fifteen years later, no country has done so.
Greenhouse gas emissions in the US per capita, already the highest of all major nations when Bush took office, have continued to rise.
In March, a leaked Bush administration report showed that US emissions are likely to rise almost as fast over the next decade as in the previous decade.
Now we have another agreement to do what those same nations said 15 years ago.
Is this a triumph?
If Bush or his successor wants to ensure that the next round of talks fails, that will be easy enough.
Justifying his refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol, Bush has consistently pointed out that it has not committed China and India to binding emission limits.
Now, in response to suggestions by Bush and other G8 leaders that the larger developing countries must be part of the solution to climate change, Ma Kai, the head of China's National Development and Reform Commission, has declared that China will not commit to quantified targets for reducing emissions.
Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna also said his country would oppose such binding restrictions.
Are China and India unreasonable?
Their leaders have repeatedly pointed out that our current problems are the result of the gases that developed nations have emitted in the last century.
That is true: most of these gases are still in the atmosphere, and without them the problem would not be nearly as urgent as it is today.
China and India claim the right to advance industrialization and development, as developed countries have done, without being hampered by limits on their greenhouse-gas emissions.
China, India and other developing countries have one point, or rather three points.
Firstly, if we apply the "you broke it, you fix it" principle, then developed countries must take responsibility for our "broken" atmosphere, which cannot absorb greenhouse gases without climate change.
Second, even if we clean the slate and forget who caused the problem, it remains true that the typical US resident is responsible for about six times more greenhouse gas emissions than the typical Chinese and up to 18 times more than the average Indian.
Third, richer nations are better placed than less affluent countries to bear the cost of fixing the problem without causing serious harm to their populations.
But it is also true that if China and India continue to increase their emissions of greenhouse gases, they will ultimately undo all the good that would come from deep emission reductions in developed countries.
This year or next, China will overtake the US as the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter on a national rather than per capita basis.
According to Fatih Birol, chief economist at the International Energy Agency, China's emissions could be double those of the US, Europe, and Japan in 25 years.
But there is a fair and practical solution:
The fairness of giving every human being on Earth an equal share of the atmosphere's ability to absorb our greenhouse gas emissions is hard to deny.
Why should anyone have a greater right to use the Earth's atmosphere than others?
But this system is not only fair, it also has practical advantages.
It would give developing countries a strong incentive to accept binding quotas, because if they can keep their per capita emissions low, they will have surplus emission rights to sell to developed countries.
Rich countries will also benefit, because they will be able to choose their preferred mix of emission reductions and the purchase of emission rights from developing countries.
Farewell to the (Glorious) War
In recent days, Italy's government fell after losing a parliamentary vote on the country's troop deployment to Afghanistan, while Britain and Denmark announced they would begin withdrawing their troops from Iraq.
As the Bush administration deploys an additional 21,000 American troops in Iraq and pushes for more allied troops in Afghanistan, America's allies are rejecting its Middle East policy.
They are increasingly convinced that a "victory" in any asymmetric conflict between states, however powerful, and sectarian armed insurgents will be hard to achieve.
Donald Rumsfeld's dogma of military transformation, the technological rearmament of an army that can deliver a decisive victory with fewer troops, has failed abruptly in Iraq.
Nor could Israel, with its overwhelming technological advantage, defeat Hezbollah in Lebanon.
In 33 days, more missiles have hit northern Israel than Britain did during the entire Second World War.
As a result, the Israelis now face an entirely new phenomenon: an asymmetrical entity, Hezbollah, with nation-state firepower.
The fierce debate over whether to increase American ground troops in Iraq thus misses the point.
Neither the Soviet experience in Afghanistan in the 1980 "s nor NATO's experience today supports the claim that troop strength is the most important thing on the modern battlefield.
When geostrategic military fronts do not exist, as in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, mass is no longer synonymous with victory.
The idea of the great military thinker Carl von Clausewitz of "decisive battles" as the "center of gravity" of war is simply irrelevant for conflicts that have no visible "center of gravity."
Whereas wars from the time of Hannibal's defeat by the Romans in 216 BC to the Gulf War in 1991 had this focus, with a massive concentration of forces capable of bringing an enemy to its knees, such industrial interstate wars are now a historical anachronism.
Most states today are within borders that are widely recognized as legitimate, and they increasingly adhere to international norms of conduct in times of war.
Indeed, the obligation of states to abide by humanitarian codes of conduct, while their enemies can make warfare barbaric, makes asymmetric wars particularly intractable.
Moreover, in an age of global media and international war crimes tribunals, the criteria for states "use of military force have become more complex than ever.
Interstate fighting can still occur when strategic front lines are in place, such as Israel's border with Syria, India's border with Pakistan, and the border between the two Koreas.
In such cases, as the Egyptians demonstrated in 1973, war could still serve as a way to resolve a conflict.
Syrians may be tempted to launch an offensive against Israel to break the deadlock over the future of the Golan Heights.
In Kashmir's case, however, the asymmetric conflict now being waged by proxies and terrorist groups may not degenerate into all-out war, precisely because India and Pakistan have mutual nuclear deterrence. Indeed, such asymmetric proxy conflicts have become the new conventional way for states to avoid the price of general war.
This changing nature of the battlefield essentially means that war has become obsolete as the final event in an international conflict.
The superficial Clausewitz wisdom that military action ultimately leads to a political solution is no longer convincing.
Victory cannot bring peace simply because there will always be war after the war.
For example, the conventional war in Kosovo lasted two months, only to begin a six-year asymmetrical conflict.
America's three-week "shock and awe" campaign in Iraq in 2003 also ended in a "victory," but opened the gates to hell to occupiers and ordinary Iraqis alike.
And six months after the relentless bombing of southern Lebanon, Hezbollah is as strong as ever.
Nor does the return of the Taliban six years after their fall in Afghanistan seem too far-fetched.
Only during the war after the war did the inferiority of the occupiers become apparent, with constant reinforcements increasing the number of targets for the insurgents much faster than the occupiers could adapt to the changing battlefield.
The insurgents in Iraq, as the British admit, were able in just three years to cope with the technological superiority of their enemies in a way that the IRA had not managed in Northern Ireland in 30 years.
The Iraq War and Israel's wars against Hamas and Hezbollah show the limits of what military power can achieve and justify diplomacy and conflict resolution.
When it comes to managing complex political and cultural conflicts, it is more important to forge international and regional alliances around a legitimate goal than mere military capabilities.
Nevertheless, it would be dangerously naive to believe that the exercise of power and the capacity for intimidation are unnecessary.
But the goals of the use of force must be linked to the realization that, in today's asymmetrical conflicts, victory is no longer achieved on the battlefield.
Only a better-informed foreign policy that can address the real fears of civilisations in crisis will produce more lasting results.
A Farewell to Nuclear Weapons
MOSCOW - Twenty-five years ago this month, I sat across from Ronald Reagan in Reykjavik, Iceland, to negotiate an agreement that could have reduced and ultimately eliminated the formidable nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union by 2000.
Despite all our differences, Reagan and I shared the firm belief that civilized countries should not make such barbaric weapons the fulcrum of their security.
Even though we failed to achieve our highest goals in Reykjavik, the summit was, in the words of my former colleague, an important turning point in the quest for a safer world.
The next few years may decide whether our shared dream of ridding the world of nuclear weapons will ever come true.
Critics portray nuclear disarmament as at best unrealistic and at worst a risky utopian dream.
They point to the Cold War's "long peace" as proof that nuclear deterrence is the only way to avert a major war.
As someone who commanded these weapons, I strongly disagree.
Nuclear deterrence has always been a tough and fragile guarantor of peace.
By failing to present a convincing plan for nuclear disarmament, the US, Russia, and the remaining nuclear powers are promoting a future in which nuclear weapons will inevitably be used.
This disaster must be prevented.
As I, along with George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger, Sam Nunn, and others, stressed five years ago, as the number of nuclear-armed states increases, nuclear deterrence becomes less reliable and more risky.
Without pre-emptive war (which has proved counterproductive) or effective sanctions (which have so far proved insufficient), only serious steps toward nuclear disarmament can ensure the mutual security necessary to forge hard compromises on arms control and non-proliferation.
The trust and understanding built up in Reykjavik paved the way for two historic treaties.
The 1987 INF Treaty destroyed the then dreaded short-range missiles that threatened peace in Europe.
And in 1991, the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) reduced the US and Soviet Union's bloated nuclear arsenals by 80% within a decade.
But prospects for progress on arms control and non-proliferation are bleak in the absence of a credible push for nuclear disarmament.
I learned during those two long days in Reykjavik that disarmament talks can be as constructive as they are laborious.
By linking a series of interrelated issues, Reagan and I created the trust and understanding needed to moderate a nuclear arms race that we had lost control of.
In retrospect, the end of the Cold War heralded the coming of a more chaotic arrangement of global power and persuasion.
The nuclear powers should abide by the provisions of the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and resume negotiations on disarmament in good faith.
This would increase the diplomatic and moral capital that diplomats have at their disposal as they seek to stem the spread of nuclear weapons in a world where more countries than ever have the means to build an atomic bomb.
Only a serious program of universal nuclear disarmament can provide the security and credibility needed to build a global consensus that nuclear deterrence is a dead doctrine.
Politically and financially, we can no longer afford the discriminatory nature of the current system of nuclear powers and the have-nots.
Reykjavik has proven that courage is rewarded.
The conditions for a disarmament agreement were far from favourable in 1986.
Before I became Soviet leader in 1985, relations between the Cold War superpowers had hit rock bottom.
Reagan and I were nevertheless able to create a reservoir of constructive spirit through constant contact and personal interaction.
What seems lacking today are leaders with the courage and vision to build the confidence needed to reintroduce nuclear disarmament as the centerpiece of a peaceful world order.
Economic constraints and the Chernobyl disaster have spurred us to act.
Why hasn't the Great Recession and the devastating meltdown at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi triggered a similar response today?
A first step would be for the US to finally ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) of 1996.
President Barack Obama has endorsed the treaty as an important tool to prevent proliferation and avert nuclear war.
It is time for Obama to deliver on the commitments he made in Prague in 2009, take Reagan's mantle as a great communicator, and convince the US Senate to formally confirm America's accession to the CTBT.
This would force the remaining holdouts - China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan - to reconsider the CTBT as well.
This would bring us closer to a worldwide ban on nuclear testing in any atmosphere, underwater, in space or underground.
A second necessary step is for the US and Russia to pursue the new START agreement and initiate deeper arms cuts, especially tactical weapons and reserve weapons that serve no purpose, waste money, and threaten security.
This step must be linked to the restriction of missile defence, one of the key issues that undermined the Reykjavik summit.
A fissile material decommissioning treaty (FMCT), long stalled at multilateral talks in Geneva, and a successful second nuclear safety summit next year in Seoul will help secure hazardous nuclear materials.
This also requires that the 2002 Global Partnership on Securing and Eliminating All Weapons of Mass Destruction - Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Weapons - be renewed and expanded when it meets in the US next year.
Our world remains too militarised.
In today's economic climate, nuclear weapons have become despicable moneypits.
If economic difficulties persist, as seems likely, the US, Russia, and other nuclear powers should seize the moment to initiate multilateral disarmament through new or existing channels, such as the UN Conference on Disarmament.
These considerations would bring more security for less money.
But the build-up of conventional forces, driven largely by the enormous military might of the US worldwide, must also be addressed.
As we seek to promote our Agreement on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), we should seriously consider reducing the burden of military budgets and armed forces around the world.
US President John F. Kennedy once warned that "every man, woman, and child lives under a nuclear sword of Damocles that hangs by the slightest thread and can be severed at any time." For more than 50 years, humanity has viewed this deadly pendulum with suspicion, while statesmen have debated how to repair its fraying ropes.
The example of Reykjavik should remind us that relief measures are not enough.
Our efforts 25 years ago can only be justified if the bomb lands in the museum of past atrocities alongside the manoeuvres of the slave traders and the mustard gas of the First World War.
A practical guide for Israeli hawks
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's announcement of the destruction of Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip, as well as some settlements in the West Bank, shocked and surprised people in Israel and around the world.
Many condemned Sharon's plan as a stunt.
But this surprise was wrong from the start.
Although it often seems so to outsiders, debates in Israel about the future of the Occupied Territories have never been confined to hawks and doves.
Like everything in Israel, the process is more complicated, especially for the hawks.
There are basically two kinds of Israeli hawks: one kind ideological and the other strategic.
Ideological hawks see the occupied territories as an integral part of the historic land of Israel, the homeland of the Jewish people.
For them, the territories are part of the Jewish heritage, which is why they insist on referring to the West Bank with its Hebrew historical name - Judea and Samaria.
Not all ideological hawks are religious, though those who base their claim on divine promises and prophecies.
But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists, and their jargon resembles that of typical Central and Eastern European nationalists.
Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir were in that category.
Ideological hawks usually come from the National Religious Party and members of Likud.
They are inspired by the nationalist ideology of Vladimir Jabotinski, who established "revisionist" Zionism as a challenge to the more moderate version advocated by Israel's founding fathers, such as Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion.
Then there are the strategic hawks.
For them, control of the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative, given Israel's narrow and vulnerable geographical position and continuing Arab hostility, but is driven by security considerations.
For them, the Jewish settlements in the territories are not a return to historical ground, but security outposts aimed at preventing - or fending off - an attack on Israel's heartland from a better strategic position.
This assessment may be right or wrong, but it is not ideological.
Ariel Sharon, who has a military background - he grew up in a social milieu much closer to the Workers "Party than to Jabotinski's ideas - is a strategic hawk.
For ideological hawks, compromise is betrayal: How can one jeopardize the Jewish people's historical heritage, let alone God's promise to Abraham?
Strategic hawks, however, are open to practical agreements and compromises - if circumstances are right and security considerations warrant them.
It is in this context that Sharon's steps should be seen.
He was elected on a promise to bring peace and security.
He didn't bring either.
With the defeat and fall of Saddam Hussein, the danger of an "Eastern Front" against Israel has diminished.
In the absence of a Palestinian partner, and in the face of continuing Palestinian terrorism - which Israel's harsh responses cannot suppress - what Sharon now seems to be doing is following his strategic thinking: erecting an effective barrier, moving some of the isolated and strategically untenable settlements, and waiting another day.
Following Sharon's statements last year, a clear pattern emerges.
First, he acknowledged that "at some point" a Palestinian state would emerge - something that would be unthinkable to die-hard ideological hawks.
A few months later, he scandalized his own Likud party congress by declaring that the occupation was wrong and untenable - another shock to those who always talk of "liberated" rather than "occupied" territories.
Last December, he explicitly declared that Israel was heading for a unilateral withdrawal, which would involve the "relocation" of some settlements.
Although it was still just empty words, it was a new language for a Likud prime minister.
Sharon's recent statements, however, explicitly specified the settlements to be evacuated; the director of the National Security Council, General Giora Eiland, was appointed chairman of an inter-ministerial resettlement committee and drew up plans for carrying out the evacuations, including compensation for resettled settlers.
All of this has radically changed Israel's domestic political map.
Some ideological hawks in Sharon's government threatened to resign.
Shimon Peres announced that the Workers "Party would provide Sharon with a parliamentary safety net; even the participation of the Workers" Party in a government of national unity is under discussion.
The test, of course, is not planning, but implementing withdrawal, and the road is long and bumpy.
Sharon's timing may have been determined by his problems with police investigations into alleged corruption.
But anyone who wants to predict Sharon's future behavior should remember that, unlike Begin and Shamir, Sharon comes from the military, and his top priority is security - not ideology.
So his apparent pragmatism should come as no surprise.
A foreign policy for new and old Europe
When I look at the news from Iraq, I remember my time as Polish Prime Minister during the 1991 Gulf War.
I watched from home on CNN as the first cruise missiles hit Baghdad.
Hours later, our military informed me that there was an armed conflict going on in Iraq. < unk > Yes, I know, '' I said. < unk > I saw the bombing on TV. '
Twelve years later, Poland's prime minister did not need a belated phone call from his military to learn that Iraq was at war.
Full details of the attack were provided in advance by the United States, Poland's current NATO ally.
Indeed, Poland has secured a leading role in the occupation of Iraq.
What a journey Poland has made since the collapse of communism in 1989!
But little of this is the result of planning, because (unfortunately) we in Poland have not thought through what kind of foreign policy we need as a NATO member and supposed member of the European Union.
We continue to focus closely on whether an initiative will be good or bad for us immediately.
Couple this with a form of foreign-policy schizophrenia - some Poles think that by "simply existing" we are influencing Europe's destiny; others suffer from crippling pessimism, relegating Poland to permanent "second-class" status - and you have a recipe for inertia.
Our attitude seems to be that things will sort themselves out somehow.
Much of Europe seems stuck in the same mindset: we say we want a common foreign and security policy, but we do nothing about it until a crisis arises.
Then we argue about what to do.
The time for such laxity is over.
For Poland and the other Eastern and Central European countries that have joined NATO or are on the verge of joining it, membership of the alliance was not really necessary.
Our history of oppression by powerful neighbors taught us that collective security within NATO was the only real option.
EU membership and the global war on terror, however, require a more thorough response.
Why so?
Because EU membership affects every aspect of a state, economy and society, while the war on terror requires a whole new type of diplomacy and security policy.
The current crisis in transatlantic relations, and our accidental involvement in it as part of Donald Rumsfeld's "New Europe," means that Poland (like any other European state) must now decide what it really wants from the EU and NATO.
We must take into account both our attitude to global problems, which were once considered peripheral to European interests, and what it really means to be an EU partner.
Only answers to these questions can bridge the gap between "new" and "old" Europe, and between the new and the old Atlantic world.
Poland, as an ally of the US, is not really a headache for President Jacques Chirac or Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
Instead, French and German leaders are really responding to the growing unpredictability of today's emerging European order.
They see new players (such as Spain) shaping EU policy, especially foreign policy, and feel that their traditional leadership is being challenged.
But an EU of ten new members simply cannot be run as it has been for decades.
So the challenge for France and Germany is not because Poland is some sort of American "Trojan horse." "
Instead, the structure of the EU now requires not only a new consensus on Europe's role in the world, but also new means to reach consensus. History cannot be put on hold while Europe adjusts its internal balance of power.
The world needs a united continent that is ready to take action.
This consensus must include the United States.
During the Cold War, most Europeans tolerated America's tendency to lead unilaterally, owing to the Soviet threat and the superiority of US power.
But America is finding it hard to understand the new circumstances of the post-Cold War era.
His difficulties are exacerbated by the dramatic disparity of military forces on both sides of the Atlantic, and his conviction that Europe's ambitions to become a military power will come to nothing because Europeans will not spend the money needed to achieve that goal.
Here Poland can help bridge the Atlantic divide and forge a European consensus.
September 1939 taught every Polish that military power must be real in order to be effective.
Intentions do not deter invasions.
Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently said: "France and Germany are not in a position to guarantee the security of our country.
The U.S. does, but security is not for nothing. ""
Most Poles think that Poland's situation is similar to Denmark's.
In fact, the whole of Europe is subject to American power.
But this dependence should not obscure the fact that there is a common foreign-policy interest between Europe and America.
If the EU builds its foreign and security policy on the understanding of this truth, many of today's divisions will disappear.
EU foreign policy should be guided by the following objectives:
the fight against terrorism,
prevent local conflicts;
promoting human rights and democracy;
Oblige unpredictable countries to take responsibility;
maintain close cooperation between Europe and the US;
to help poor countries.
Poland's foreign policy, like that of the EU, can only be effective in the long term if it takes realistic steps - and spends the necessary money - to achieve these goals.
They are the only possible foundation in transatlantic relations, in an enlarged Union and in relations between "new" and "old" Europe.
A good fracking story
PRAGUE - Weather conditions around the world have provided ample fodder for the debate on global warming this summer.
Droughts and heat waves are a harbinger of our future, cuts in carbon dioxide are now more necessary than ever, and yet no meaningful action has been taken.
But beyond this well-trodden battlefield, something astonishing has happened: carbon dioxide emissions in the United States have fallen to their lowest level in 20 years.
Estimates based on data from the US Energy Information Agency (EIA) for the first five months of 2012 suggest that expected CO2 emissions this year have fallen by more than 800 million tonnes, or 14 percent, since their peak in 2007.
This is due to an unprecedented switch to natural gas, which emits 45% less carbon per unit of energy.
The US used to generate about half of its electricity from coal and about 20 percent from gas.
Over the past five years, these figures have changed, initially slowly and now dramatically: in April this year, coal's share of electricity generation fell to just 32%, equal to that of gas.
America's rapid switch to natural gas is the result of three decades of technological innovation, particularly the development of hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," which has unlocked vast new resources of previously inaccessible shale gas.
Despite some legitimate safety concerns, it is hard to overstate the overwhelming benefits.
For starters, fracking has caused gas prices to fall dramatically.
Adjusted for inflation, gas has not been as cheap over the past 35 years, with prices three to five times lower this year than in the mid-2000s.
And while a weakening economy might explain a small part of the decline in US carbon emissions, the EIA stresses that the most important explanation is natural gas.
The decline is even more impressive when one considers that the US population has grown by 57 million additional energy consumers over the past two decades.
Indeed, per capita US CO2 emissions have fallen by about 20%, and are now at their lowest level since Dwight D. Eisenhower left the White House in 1961.
David Victor, an energy expert at the University of California, San Diego, estimates that switching from coal to natural gas has reduced US emissions by 400-500 megatons (Mt) of CO2 per year.
To put this figure into perspective, it is about twice the total impact of the Kyoto Protocol on carbon emissions in the rest of the world, including the European Union.
It is tempting to believe that renewable energy sources are responsible for the reductions in emissions, but the figures clearly tell a different story.
America's 30,000 wind turbines reduce emissions by only one-tenth of the amount that natural gas produces.
Biofuels reduce emissions by only ten Mt and solar panels by a paltry three Mt.
This contradicts conventional thinking, which still maintains that carbon cuts through emissions trading or a carbon tax are the only way to combat climate change.
But, in Europe's experience, such measures are precisely the wrong way to address global warming.
Since 1990, the EU has heavily subsidized solar and wind energy at a cost of more than $20 billion annually.
But its per capita CO2 emissions have fallen by less than half of the reduction achieved in the US - and in percentage terms, the US is better off today.
There is no gas miracle in the EU, owing to widespread European scepticism about fracking, while the abundance of heavily subsidised renewable energy has led to overachievement of the CO2 target.
Along with the closure of German nuclear power stations, this has ironically led to a resurgence of coal.
Well-meaning US policymakers have also shown how to fight global warming with subsidies and tax breaks.
The relatively small reductions in emissions from wind power cost more than $3.3 billion annually, and the much smaller reductions from ethanol (biofuels) and solar panels cost at least $8.5 billion and $3 billion annually.
Estimates suggest that using carbon taxes to achieve a further carbon reduction of 330 Mt in the EU would cost $250 billion per year. In the meantime, the fracking bonanza in the US not only brings a much larger free reduction, but also creates long-term social benefits through lower energy costs.
The astonishing truth is that fracking has succeeded where Kyoto and carbon taxes have failed.
According to a study by the Breakthrough Institute, fracking relied on substantial government investment in technological innovation for three decades.
Climate economists have repeatedly pointed out that such an energy innovation is the most effective climate solution, because it is the surest way to lower the price of future green energy sources below the price of fossil fuels.
By contrast, subsidising current, ineffective solar energy or ethanol usually wastes money and favors vested interests.
Fracking is not a panacea, but it really is by far the best green energy option this decade.
A Free Lunch for America
BERKELEY - Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers had a good line at this year's International Monetary Fund meetings: governments, Summers said, try to treat a broken ankle when a patient faces organ failure.
But on the other side of the Atlantic, Americans have no reason to feel complacent.
Summers could have used the same metaphor to criticize the United States, where the continued focus on the long-term financing dilemmas of Social Security deprives efforts to address America's macroeconomic and unemployment crisis of all oxygen.
The US government can currently borrow for 30 years at a real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate of 1% per year.
Imagine if the US government borrowed an additional $500 billion over the next two years and spent on infrastructure - even unproductive - on projects for which the social return is a paltry 25% per year.
Suppose, as seems to be the case, that the simple Keynesian expenditure multiplier for this expenditure is only two.
In that case, the $500 billion in additional federal infrastructure spending over the next two years would generate $1 trillion in additional production of goods and services, create about seven million additional years of employment, and reduce the unemployment rate by two percentage points in each of those years.
And, with closer ties between those in work and the labor force, the unemployment rate would likely fall by about 0.1 percentage points indefinitely.
The impressive gains do not stop there.
Better infrastructure would mean an additional $20 billion a year in income and welfare.
A lower unemployment rate in the future would mean another $20 billion a year of higher output.
And half of the additional $1 trillion in goods and services would turn out to be consumer goods and services for American households.
In short, on the benefits side of the equation: more jobs now, $500 billion in additional consumption of goods and services over the next two years, and then $40 billion a year in higher incomes and output each year thereafter.
So what is the likely cost of an additional $500 billion in infrastructure spending over the next two years?
For starters, the $500 billion in additional government spending would likely be offset by $300 billion in higher tax revenues from higher economic activity.
So the net result would be a $200 billion increase in the national debt.
American taxpayers would then have to pay $2 billion in real interest on this additional national debt over the next 30 years, and then repay or overdraw the entire $200 billion.
But the $40 billion in increased economic activity each year would generate about $10 billion in additional tax revenue each year.
Using some of it to pay the real interest on the debt and save the rest would mean that the tax-financed reserves generated by the healthier economy would be more than sufficient to pay off the additional government debt when the bill matures.
In other words, taxpayers win because the benefits of a healthier economy would more than offset the cost of servicing the higher national debt, allowing the government to provide more services without raising tax rates.
Households are also gaining because they can buy more and nicer things with their income.
Businesses are winning because goods and workers can take advantage of improved infrastructure.
The unemployed win because some of them get jobs.
And even bond investors are winning because they get their money back with the interest they have contractually committed to.
So what's not to like?
Nothing.
How, you might ask, can I say that?
I am an economist and professor of economics, where there is no free lunch, where benefits are always offset by costs, and where stories that sound too good to be true are almost inevitably true.
But there are two things that are different today.
First, the US labor market is failing so badly that expanding government expenditures does not incur resource costs for society as a whole.
Second, bond investors are really stupid.
In a world where the S & P 500 has an annual return of 7%, no one should be happy to hold a 30-year inflation-adjusted US government bond that yields 1% per year.
That six-percentage-point difference in expected real returns is a measure of bond investors "extraordinary and irrational panic.
They are prepared to pay six per cent a year for security.
For now, however, the US government can create security out of thin air by simply printing bonds.
The government, too, would gain by adding that 6% a year - though bondholders who now feel like winners would most likely look at their portfolios with the exceptionally poor performance of 2011-2041 and change their strategy.
A French remedy against the resource curse
NEW YORK - The campaign to ensure that extractive companies disclose all payments in their host countries is gaining momentum - and France is leading the effort.
President Nicolas Sarkozy should be applauded for supporting a new initiative to promote strict transparency standards for oil, gas and mining companies listed on European stock exchanges.
France, at the heart of the European Union and this year chair of both the G-8 and the G-20, is in an exceptional position to promote such a regulatory move.
Under French leadership, 2011 provides a unique opportunity for major capital markets to adopt clear, precise rules that require full financial disclosure of extractive industry companies to public authorities.
Oil, gas, and mining bring billions of dollars annually to governments and businesses.
Moreover, these industries often play a central role in the economic development of resource-rich countries.
However, despite the great natural wealth, the majority of people in these countries live in poverty.
The actual taxes and payments that mining, oil, and other extractive industries make to governments are usually a closely guarded secret, though most of these governments claim to use the revenue for the common good.
In reality, ordinary citizens in far too many countries do not benefit from this money; in fact, they bear the brunt of the environmental and social costs of mining and drilling.
In fact, these well-kept industrial and government secrets can have serious and widespread consequences.
Consider the upheavals in North Africa and the Middle East.
In these countries, many of which are rich in oil and gas, citizens are protesting against corruption and political repression.
Basically, they are protesting against the mismanagement of their countries "wealth and resources, with implications for the security and affordability of the world's energy supply.
Transparency is an essential part of the solution; citizens everywhere must be guaranteed that oil and gas companies and mining companies publish all relevant financial information, broken down by country and project, including all payments to the host country's public budgets.
If European regulators can agree on this requirement for all commodity companies listed on their stock exchanges, this transparency standard will apply to companies, wherever they are headquartered.
Regulators must also require that company reports are made available regularly and promptly and that they are transnational and comparable.
The United States has already passed legislation requiring public disclosure of payments to governments through the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.
This law requires companies to fully disclose their sources of income by country and project, for 90% of international oil and gas companies and for eight of the ten largest mining companies.
This will help citizens to monitor how this money is used, but it will not help them to judge whether their governments are taking a fair share.
If the EU required companies to publish detailed information on production and operating figures, financial and accounting balances and payments to public authorities, companies would be truly accountable to citizens and government revenues would increase.
Such regulatory reforms are currently being considered by the European Commission, and France's support is essential if the EU is to announce the necessary legislative steps to promote transparency this month.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde recently stressed the need to promote initiatives within industrial sectors aimed at improving governance, integrity, and transparency in economic transactions.
At their just concluded summit in Deauville, France, the G8 called for mandatory reporting by oil, gas and mining companies for the first time. This is an important step forward, but unfortunately it is put into perspective by formulations that allow voluntary approaches as an alternative and focuses only on the transparency of payments.
The world must now look to the G-20 summit in Cannes in November to unequivocally commit to the reporting obligations required, as key emerging economies such as Brazil, India, and China, as well as South Africa and other resource-rich African countries, will be around the table.
The importance of financial transparency in the extractive industry is not limited to one country or one era, and it is too important to be left to voluntary efforts alone.
Greater accountability and governance for such companies could potentially transform lives, economies, and political systems around the world.
A primer of the French president
The late British Prime Minister Harold Wilson quipped that a week in politics is a long time.
So, with the next French presidential election around 30 weeks away, any prediction made today before the vote could be reversed and reversed.
But two candidates have emerged as clear and consistent favorites in opinion polls: Nicolas Sarkozy on the right and Ségolène Royal on the left.
In fact, they have more in common than is apparent at first sight, for each speaks of a break with the past and at the same time embodies a form of continuity.
For Sarkozy, the rupture reflects both mundane tactical and deeply personal choices.
The 12 years of Jacques Chirac's presidency, as well as France's tradition of shifting power, point to a victory for the left.
Positioning oneself as a candidate that represents a sharp break with today's unpopular policies is the only way to escape this fate.
This is reflected in Sarkozy's openly pro-American stance - an act of political courage in a France where anti-Americanism is high on the agenda.
Sarkozy's message is that Chirac and Villepin were right on substance in opposing America's military adventure in Iraq, but that their style was catastrophically wrong.
So his deep admiration for "American values," while sincere, does not imply a embrace of President George W. Bush.
It also reassures the French economy, which was shocked by Dominique de Villepin's flamboyant opposition to the United States when he was Chirac's foreign minister.
At home, Sarkozy addresses his message primarily to the young and patriotically calls for the values of work and discipline, a counter-revolutionary revolution.
The revolution that must be overcome is that of May 1968, whose leaders and supporters, according to Sarkozy, lost politically to de Gaulle, but profoundly weakened France in the decades that followed by their emphasis on false values.
By contrast, rebellion against one's own generation and the rediscovery of traditional moral attitudes will save France a message that is highly applicable to issues like education and immigration that could dominate the campaign.
In the case of Royal, the meaning of "rupture" is both more obvious and more visible.
She aspires to become the first President of the French Republic.
To achieve her goal, she prefers to emphasize her "essence," countering Sarkozy's emphasis on his role as a "doer."
Her appeal to voters is simple: "I'm a woman and you've never tried on a woman before, so be modern and try now."
Royal hid behind the originality (in French presidential politics) of her gender and avoided naming a detailed program.
When challenged by inquisitive journalists demanding more detail about her political agenda, her most effective line of defense (so far!) was: "You wouldn't dare ask me such a question if I weren't a woman!"
So Royale's programme is her popularity.
When it comes to foreign policy, we can only guess what its priorities would be.
As for Europe, she seems as "agnostic" as Sarkozy, who, like her, embodies a new generation of post-European leaders.
In terms of values, too, Royal's emphasis on discipline and family seems to represent a break with May 1968.
According to polls, Royal is the clear favorite of the left and the only candidate who can beat Sarkozy.
Her support is strong, especially among female voters.
For the Socialist Party, which is eager to return to power but has not yet recovered from Lionel Jospin's humiliating defeat in the first round of the 2002 presidential election, the question is whether it can afford to resist the wave of positive public opinion behind Royal.
The dominance of the media in the political process, in the view of many of King's opponents, leads to mediocrity among socialist leaders and militants: the qualities required for the election are almost incompatible with those needed to govern.
Royal's socialist critics say the "Hollywoodisation" of the policies from which she benefits entails a new approach in which leaders follow and lead followers.
But the same criticism can also be directed at Sarkozy.
Moreover, both candidates represent continuity with both Chirac's Gaullist side for Sarkozy and François Mitterrand for Royal.
Royal openly claims Mitterand's legacy in search of legitimacy, while Sarkozy's rejection of Chirac's legacy has more to do with form than substance.
Sarkozy can be widely seen as Chirac with more, while Royal is clearly Mitterrand with less.
If voters decide in the spring of 2007, their decision may hinge more on negative than positive considerations, as in 2002, when Chirac faced the odious nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen in the second round.
As in 2002, the one who voters like or fear less will win next year.
But, one way or another, personalities will prevail over programs.
A fresh start for China and Japan?
Edmonton - Chinese President Hu Jintao will make a high-profile visit to Japan from May 6-10, becoming the second Chinese head of state ever to visit the country.
The trip is carefully organized by both countries and closely watched around the world, and with good reason: Sino-Japanese relations over the past decade have been tumultuous, to say the least.
When Hu's predecessor, Jiang Zemin, traveled to Japan a decade ago, bilateral relations deteriorated: China was unhappy with the Japanese government's refusal to issue the same apology to South Korea for past aggressions.
Concerned about a rising China, Japan went on a confrontational course.
The Japanese media reported mostly negatively on the visit, and it was remembered as a PR disaster.
Hu succeeded Jiang in 2002, almost as former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi came to power in Japan, and encouraged "new thinking" in China's Japan policy, which would involve moving away from historical grievances and promoting better relations.
But, rather than accept China's olive branch, Koizumi implemented a more nationalist agenda, including annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, which Japan's neighbors see as a symbol of Japanese militarism.
His hardline approach isolated Japan and angered China, leading to anti-Japanese demonstrations in China in 2005.
But both Japan and China recognize that further tensions will not serve either country in the long run.
Koizumi's successors, Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda, have tried to engage China over the past two years, with summits in Beijing and a successful visit to Japan by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao last year.
Hu's trip is likely to follow Wen's example.
It will emphasise common strategic interests, emphasise mutual economic benefits, generate positive public opinion and encourage further exchanges.
Japan is not only one of China's largest trade and investment partners; it is also the most powerful neighbor with which China wants to maintain good relations, in part to show that China's rise is not a threat to Asia and the rest of the world.
Japan, whose economic recovery stems largely from its deepening relationship with China in recent years, is also eager to show that it sees China not as a threat, but as an opportunity, at least economically.
Thirty years ago, former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, the current Prime Minister's father, signed a peace and friendship treaty with China.
The two governments will no doubt use Hu's visit to celebrate the anniversary with new programs to promote bilateral understanding and friendship.
But, unlike three decades ago, when the Japanese viewed China as one of their preferred countries, public opinion in both countries today registers more negative than positive feelings.
Behind the smiles, polite interactions, and carefully worded diplomatic language, there are strong undercurrents of distrust.
One problem is the disputed waters in the East China Sea.
Despite new joint energy efficiency and environmental projects, in which China ranks Japan as the best-performing country among developed countries, the two sides remain bitterly divided over these territorial waters, which contain vast potential oil, gas, and other minerals.
Even after many rounds of talks, no solution is in sight, and no breakthrough is expected from Hu's visit.
Then there are strategic suspicions.
Fukuda has dropped Abe's talk of an "arc of freedom" to forge a bloc with the United States, Australia, and India.
But Japan remains concerned about China's rapid military modernization, while China worries about a possible US-Japan containment strategy for China, especially in the event of a crisis in the Taiwan Strait.
So, while both sides support the idea of a "mutually beneficial strategic relationship," and despite bilateral progress in military exchanges, mutual trust and confidence-building still have a long way to go.
Moreover, today's "warm politics, cool economy" is the opposite of the "cold politics, warm economy" under Koizumi.
Last year, Japan's committed investment projects in China fell by 24% compared to 2006, while actual investment fell by 25%, in part due to regulatory changes in China regarding foreign investment.
Recent food safety issues, such as cases of poisoned dumplings, have significantly increased Japanese public sensitivity to Chinese exports.
Finally, historical issues could still arise and create new problems.
While Fukuda has made it clear that he will not visit the Yasukuni Shrine, 160 other lawmakers paid tribute to the site last month, a sign that conservative forces in Japan remain strong and that future prime ministers may not want to give up a visit to the Yasukuni Shrine.
And Japan has so far failed to meet its treaty obligations to clean up between 700,000 and two million chemical weapons left behind by the Japanese army in China at the end of World War II - another potential flashpoint if one of those weapons causes casualties in China.
A New Beginning for Europe in Latin America?
MILAN - By 2050, Brazil and Mexico will be among the world's top six economies, according to analysts at the investment bank Goldman Sachs.
Does the European Union care?
Should Latin America be Europe's next missed business opportunity?
Latin America has a population of 550 million people, with an average annual per capita income of $4,000, immense natural resources, and considerable human capital.
It accounts for 8% of world production and has grown by more than 5% in each of the last three years.
Although the United States remains the primary destination for Latin American and Caribbean exports, Asia is becoming an increasingly important market for natural-resource-based goods.
Over the past four years, Latin America has attracted an average of $61 billion in foreign direct investment, 60% of which has gone to Brazil and Mexico.
In the 1990s, foreign investors were attracted mainly by privatization programs in the region, but more recently, mergers and acquisitions and green-field projects have been the most common type of investment.
As expected, Spain is the main European investor in the region, although several important Spanish activities have recently been transferred to Italian companies, including the utility Endesa, which was acquired by Enel, now Latin America's largest private energy company.
Meanwhile, Latin American companies have increased their own foreign investment.
In 2006, Brazil invested $28.2 billion abroad, compared with inflows of $18.8 billion.
Indeed, emerging giants from Latin America and Asia will be at the center of global investment for decades to come.
In 2006, the Italian Fiat Group and India's Tata Motors established a joint venture to manufacture passenger cars and engines in India.
The following year, they extended their partnership to Latin America, investing $80 million in the production of a Tata pick-up truck at Fiat's plant in Cordoba, Argentina.
It is to be hoped that many other large European corporations will follow suit.
But small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - the majority of businesses in Latin America and Europe - find it difficult to act and invest internationally, partly because of high transaction and information costs.
In Europe, SME clusters seem to be able to achieve economies of scale and scale and thus to be successful together in global markets.
This European experience is currently being extensively studied in Latin America.
In Brazil, four local production systems have joined together to form Project Promos / Sebrae / BID, using the industrial areas of Italy as an example.
Between 2002 and 2006, Brazil's support services for SMEs and the Milan Chamber of Commerce formed partnerships between furniture, footwear, designer underwear and handicrafts from various regions of the country.
This approach could well be the shape of things to come.
However, although the EU's association agreement with Mexico is ten years old, there is still no strategic partnership with Brazil.
This is partly due to the interminable negotiation process with Mercosur, the troubled and still incomplete Latin American customs union.
The EU is currently negotiating trade liberalisation agreements with all Latin American regional blocs: Mercosur, the Caribbean Community, the Central American Common Market and the Andean Community.
The EU must push its Latin American partners towards further integration.
The introduction of a common "rule of origin" for their products would be an incentive to further liberalise and thus increase their international trade.
Full trade liberalisation in Latin America, while difficult to achieve, must be placed at the heart of the EU's strategy and would stimulate economic growth.
But even if tariffs and quotas are gradually reduced, trade flows could remain low if other trade costs remain high.
EU cooperation should therefore be geared towards reducing trade costs.
The key issue is market access.
Most Latin American countries are still achieving poor results in their efforts to export to Europe, with the exception of raw materials and energy resources.
Following the establishment of the free trade area between the EU and Chile, Chilean exports to the EU increased considerably.
But in the case of trade liberalization between the EU and Mexico, the growth of imports from the EU exceeded the growth of exports to Europe, resulting in a growing Mexican trade deficit with the EU.
This contradicts the EU's proclamations since the Rio Summit in 1999 that Latin America is an important political and economic partner.
A change in the European approach is needed to create a strategic partnership.
The European Commission understands this.
Although the EU does not have a strategic partnership with Brazil, it intends to take it forward as quickly as possible.
In mid-2007, the Commission confirmed that it would resume the EU's dialogue with Mercosur in order to give fresh impetus to the negotiations.
But there is also a strong awareness that the EU's hopes for a special relationship with Brazil must not hamper regional integration or exacerbate asymmetries and imbalances within the bloc.
If Latin America is to become a strategic partner for the EU and a more attractive market for European companies, European institutions must become more open to the needs of the region.
A fresh start by the EU with Brazil and Mexico could prove promising because of the potential pull effect on other countries.
However, this must be accompanied by measures to keep all Latin American countries on board.
Otherwise, Latin America could prove Europe's next missed business opportunity.
A New Beginning for Europe
As European leaders gather in Portugal to put the finishing touches to the new, slimmed-down Reform Treaty, it might be helpful if they all acted as if the last 50 years of European integration had never happened.
Let us then imagine what Europe needs to do to meet its most pressing challenges, especially if it could do so without the political constraints of 50 years of EU deals and ramshackle institution-building.
On top of that, let us take a big leap of the imagination and assume that, even if this EU scenario in year zero means that we do not have half a century of intra-European cooperation to fall back on, the nations that make up the EU today would still be keen to pursue far-reaching common policies.
So let us suspend our incredulity and try to imagine what Europe could and should do to address some of the most far-reaching and intractable political challenges that will determine whether the next 50 years will be as constructive as the last.
In other words, let us look at our problems in the light of the EU's existing mechanisms and its potential to develop far-reaching new policies, and then ask ourselves why the EU is not fulfilling its own potential and supplying the goods.
Broadly speaking, we see three areas in which Europe's policymakers can do better at national and EU level: global challenges where Europe could play a greater leadership role, the creation and strengthening of human capital within the EU and globally, and improving the effectiveness of the EU's own political machinery.
Europe needs a clearer and more recognisable global agenda.
It must build substantially on its leadership on climate change by adopting much stricter EU targets, and then use its international economic and trade clout to push for new global emissions standards that can be accepted by scientific opinion as useful.
On conflict and security issues, Europe should enter a new phase in which it adopts much clearer and unambiguous positions on issues ranging from nuclear proliferation to sanctions against Burma's military regime.
The aim must be to establish Europe as a powerful and fair player on the world stage and not as a "broad church" in which different viewpoints coexist.
The aim should be to combine soft power instruments such as EU development aid and economic partnerships with a growing sense of political and security reach to ensure that Europe is a global player to be reckoned with.
This, of course, means that the EU should try to broaden its transatlantic thinking in such a way that the EU and the United States work more closely together to define and protect their common interests in a world in which they together make up barely more than 10% of the total population.
These points are anything but a blanket criticism of the EU's efforts to create a common foreign and security policy.
But they should underscore what many people in Europe know very well: the pace at which problems of international development and conflict are growing far exceeds the EU's policy responses to date.
Building up more human capital in Europe and globally is a key element of future EU activities.
Education is by far the most profitable investment that Europe can make, so it should launch its most ambitious strategy ever to create a new dynamics of knowledge and employment within the EU, while at the same time helping to greatly develop education in the poorest countries in the world.
Europe must finally grasp the nettle of immigration policy - something that has doggedly eluded generations of politicians.
EU-wide immigration rules are needed to reconcile Europe's shrinking appetite for imported labor with widespread fears of cultural tensions and social unrest.
It will not be easy to create a fairer and multicultural Europe, but if this problem is not addressed openly, the price will be even higher.
Likewise, European governments should make a determined new effort to strengthen Europeans "sense of a common history and shared values.
A stronger European identity is the most solid basis for creating a more multicultural society, which demographers consider inevitable.
Meanwhile, doubts remain about the political and institutional machinery that the EU will need to achieve this and other ambitious goals.
There was a sigh of relief after EU leaders agreed on a reform treaty to revise the Union's decision-making mechanisms mid-year, but it is still uncertain whether the new pact will survive the ratification process in 27 countries.
However, we believe that the enhanced application of qualified majority voting by the Member States' governments, as enshrined in the new Treaty, should also be applied to the ratification process itself.
If it turns out that a small minority of EU governments are unable to ratify the Treaty, it would not be torpedoed in 2005 like its predecessor, the Constitutional Treaty.
A future for the world's coral reefs?
Coral reefs are the most biologically rich marine ecosystems in the world and host some of the most beautiful organisms in the world.
They are the most important source of protein for more than ten million people worldwide.
Reef-based activities (mainly fishing and tourism) provide the economic livelihoods for millions more.
Clearly, the human cost of the global collapse of these ecosystems is enormous.
But the global decline of coral reefs is severe and continuing.
In some places, reef ecosystems have deteriorated comprehensively, and a global collapse is a real risk.
But there is also good news: we know what steps the international community can now take to protect and restore the "resilience" of reefs - their ability to maintain their integrity in the face of the environmental fluctuations that are a natural part of life in any ecosystem.
We need to counteract the severity of global warming while preserving the resilience of coral reefs.
Historically, overfishing and pollution, not global warming, have been the main causes of reef degradation.
As the number of prey in healthy ecosystems declines, the predators become malnourished and their numbers decrease, giving their prey a chance to recover.
But human predators are different: when the number of our prey decreases, their economic value tends to increase, so fishing intensifies.
This means that once predatory fish species are depleted, fishing pressure shifts to herbivorous fish species, leading to a sharp decline in herbivores on coral reefs.
Herbivorous fish play a key role in coral reefs.
When coral populations decline after hurricanes, diseases, and other disturbances, it is the herbivores that keep the algae in check and allow coral populations to recover.
Without them, fast-growing algae quickly take up their place on the reef and prevent healthy coral populations from being restored.
Since corals form the habitat structure on which other reef organisms depend, the reduction in coral cover leads to a large reduction in the biodiversity of a reef.
Pollution by nutrients and toxins from adjacent land areas impairs the ability of coral populations to recover and gives algae an even greater competitive advantage.
Corals are formed by a symbiosis between an animal and a single-celled plant.
The animal provides shelter and nutrients to the plant; the plant converts sunlight into energy that it shares with the animal.
For reasons not yet fully understood, this partnership breaks down when corals experience abnormally high temperatures.
The plant is driven away and the corals turn bright white.
If temperatures return to normal soon, the partnership can be restored.
But if corals stay "bleached" for too long, they die.
For many coral species, this bleaching threshold is usually only a few degrees Celsius above the typical maximum temperature for a specific location.
In the light of even the most optimistic scenarios for global warming, this is worrying news.
If coral bleaching thresholds remain constant, local summer temperatures will regularly exceed these thresholds within a few decades.
Corals grow slowly, so that reefs that show severe bleaching do not recover until they bleach again.
Fortunately, there is evidence that bleaching thresholds are developing.
Most coral species are geographically widely distributed and bleach at different temperatures depending on the location.
Many species that bleach at 28 or 29 degrees Celsius on Australia's Great Barrier Reef routinely tolerate temperatures of 34 degrees or more in the Arabian Sea.
Unfortunately, we do not know how long it will take for such an adjustment to take place.
Two things can be done to protect coral reefs.
The first is obvious: to minimize global warming by, say, meeting the Kyoto Protocol's emissions targets.
Second, we need to restore coral reefs "ability to cope with environmental changes - their resilience - by protecting the fish stocks that keep the algae in check, thereby facilitating coral populations" recovery from bleaching.
These recovery phases make it possible to adapt to higher temperatures.
Without fish, the dominance of algae will prevent this recovery.
The catastrophic collapse of fish stocks around the world - on coral reefs and elsewhere - has taught harsh lessons about the management of fish stocks.
Many highly regulated fisheries have collapsed with unregulated ones.
There is thus a growing consensus that standard techniques for managing fish stocks must be supplemented by a system of "no-take zones" - zones in which fishing is completely prohibited.
When fish stocks recover in these no-take zones, they cause transmission effects, with catches often increasing in areas outside the no-take zones.
More importantly, they provide a refuge for fish stocks, a kind of insurance against stock collapse.
On coral reefs, these no-take zones can help to maintain a healthy fish community in part of the coral reef habitat and ensure the resulting resilience of the coral reef.
Scientific evidence suggests that 30-50% of the available habitat should be designated as no-go zones in order to be effective.
This figure is far higher than even in the richest countries with significant coral reefs, the US and Australia, where the current level of protection is less than 5%.
Given the scale of the threat to global coral reefs, the international community has reacted alarmingly slowly.
But there is some encouraging news: in June, the Australian government proposed increasing the number of no-fly zones in the Great Barrier Reef to more than 30%.
If implemented, this policy would set a new global standard and perhaps encourage other nations to follow suit.
The future of tropical marine ecosystems and the millions of people whose lives are connected to them depend on it.
A future without precedent
JERUSALEM - In nearly nine decades of life, I cannot remember a time when the past was so irrelevant to politics.
None of today's major developments were predicted by anyone.
Experts studied the past, but could not see the future because of old paradigms.
Today's dynamic complexity, in which a science-based, rapidly changing global economy combines so many other phenomena, prevents us from predicting the future through linear extrapolations of the past.
The only certainty is that the future will be determined by scientific progress and innovation that cannot be known in advance.
As a result, the traditional power of states and politicians is declining; in today's global economy, innovators, not politicians, exert the greatest influence.
The globalised economy affects every state, but no single state can determine the results, because science and technology are boundless.
Global companies want to do business worldwide, undermining not only sovereignty, but also racism and prejudice, and significantly weakening nationalism.
This shift has placed the world in the hands of a younger generation, more technologically savvy than their parents, and connected by social networks that are not confined by territory, language, or government.
The young leaders that Facebook and Google have created have had greater global influence than many statesmen and generals.
These young people are also the leaders of burgeoning political protest movements.
The "Arab Spring," tent demonstrations in Israel, Occupy Wall Street, and protests in Russia reveal not a clash of civilizations, but a clash of generations.
The younger generation understands that the way states and economies are currently run is unfit for the new era.
But there are political "hitchhikers" who want to take advantage of the recent awakening, not by promoting an agenda of freedom, but by imposing a different kind of coercion.
In the Arab world, it is above all extreme Islamists who are taking advantage of the wave of the younger generation and stealing their revolution.
Israel has responded positively to the will of the younger generation, but it cannot and should not interfere in events in the Arab world.
Our hearts are with the rebelling youth and their legitimate desire for freedom and fundamental rights to express themselves, elect their leaders and earn their own livelihoods.
Israelis are waiting for the day when our country will no longer be the only democracy in the region, because it is unnatural to be an island of prosperity in a sea of poverty.
Nevertheless, there is a real concern that the politically well-organised extremists are trying to use the elections to gain control over the less organised liberals, thereby preventing peace and stability.
Fundamentalist radicals cannot offer real solutions to the region's fundamental problems.
The social changes currently taking place threaten their way of life, which includes discrimination against women and the prohibition of modern education.
But only deep reforms of traditional authority can pave the way to freedom and growth.
Israel can serve as an example to others who aspire to economic prosperity and social freedom, because its success is based on the fact that it had absolutely nothing at the beginning.
We returned to our homeland, rich in history but without natural resources.
Israel remained only one resource: its human capital.
So we invested in education and science, and today we have the highest proportion of scientists and patents per capita in the world.
About 95% of our agriculture is high-tech.
We use less water and yield more per hectare than any other country in the world.
What Israel can do, others can do.
If you are willing to reach for it, we will gladly extend a helping hand to you.
Together, in peace with our neighbours, we can create a region of hope, development and success.
In particular, we must do everything in our power to end the conflict with the Palestinians.
Israel was not born, and it is not Israel's destiny to govern another people.
We are sincerely interested in establishing a Palestinian state living peacefully side by side with Israel, the democratic state of the Jewish people.
For us, peace is both a moral imperative and a national security strategy, because resolving the conflict would help stabilize the region by neutralizing the extremists who seek to manipulate today's popular movements to advance their radical agenda.
The international community can support these efforts by providing incentives to countries that choose freedom and progress.
At the same time, decisive and determined action must be taken against extremists.
In particular, Iran is a source of moral corruption, leading extremism and stopping reform, crushing legitimate protest by its own citizens, and fighting the brave Syrians who are now fighting for their freedom.
Iran is also using proxies to incite terror against moderates in the Palestinian Authority, Lebanon and Iraq.
If Iran succeeds in its plan to acquire nuclear weapons, its leaders could shake the Middle East and encourage more extremism and violence.
Israel will defend itself if Iran continues to call for its destruction.
However, the threat is not only directed against Israel.
Iran is a threat to the peace and stability of the whole world.
The world's democracies have declared that they will not allow Iran to possess nuclear weapons; it is their duty to fulfill that obligation before it becomes impossible.
Beyond the short-term challenges ahead, we all have a duty to fundamentally change the way we prepare our children to face today's new world.
At a time when yesterday has become almost irrelevant and we can hardly predict tomorrow, the role of education must enable all children to reach their maximum potential.
Today's educators should inspire our children to creativity and innovation.
Self-expression is as important as freedom of expression.
I am writing this in the 88th year of my life, but not because I have learned from experience.
On the contrary, experience is overrated and often limits the courage to face up to tomorrow and build an unprecedented new world.
The future is already there; there is no point in looking back.
A Breath from Europe
French President Jacques Chirac has alarmed the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
The French President has accused them of being 'childish' and 'irresponsible' for expressing their pro-American stance on Iraq and warned that their position could be 'dangerous' as the decision to admit them to the EU has not yet been ratified.
Quite a volley.
Then the French president took on the role of kindergarten teacher to what he called "poorly behaved" candidate countries, telling them that they were "poorly behaved" and had "missed a great opportunity to shut up."
For anyone who remembers that 40 years ago President Charles de Gaulle slammed the door on Europe in the face of Britain's application to join the European Community - the General thought the British were too tied to the US to join the European family - these remarks are worrying.
But put things into perspective: Jacques Chirac is not Charles de Gaulle, and Europe has gone way beyond the time when its agenda was unilaterally written by France.
President Chirac's self-appointed role as an expert on diplomatic good behavior cannot be taken seriously, even by those of us who know (and love) France.
Instead, his outburst is best explained as a sign of frustration that French influence in the EU is being diluted.
Like King Lear after the loss of his kingdom, France can do nothing about its lost influence, except rage impotently.
But this dispute within Europe runs deeper than the question of France's diminished supremacy.
I have always been sceptical about the rhetoric of a "common" EU foreign policy.
How can a country like France, for example, be expected to accept being voted out of office by its EU partners on crucial foreign and security policy issues?
At best, Europe should hope for a "common" foreign and security policy, even if that does not answer Henry Kissinger's old question: who do you call if you want to talk to "Europe"?
I have long worked to ensure a "much more common" foreign policy within the EU.
I am therefore concerned about today's division within the EU and between some Member States and the US over Iraq.
When eight European leaders issued their appeal to bridge the widening transatlantic divide, they were accused of undermining European unity.
Nothing could be more wrong.
They only exposed the lack of unity that already existed.
It all began last fall, when German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, desperate to cling to power, made Iraq an issue in the German election campaign.
He alluded to the well-known and respectable pacifist sentiments of Germany.
But by declaring that he would not, under any circumstances, participate in military action against Iraq, he undermined the UN's efforts to exert maximum pressure behind calls for Iraq's disarmament.
Then France embraced Germany.
French approaches to foreign policy are often opaque and difficult to decipher, unless it is crystal clear where France sees its interests.
Normally, France likes to keep its options open.
But when the French and German governments celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the Élysée Treaty last month, France seemed to be maneuvering itself into a corner by supporting the German view.
All this was done without consultation between the French and German governments and their partners within the EU.
It was a demonstration of the special relationship between France and Germany that has been the driving force of European integration for so many years.
The history of Franco-German reconciliation is indeed impressive.
But it can no longer be taken for granted that other EU countries will automatically ratify the agreements they conclude with each other as guiding principles of common policy.
This is especially true when their goal is to establish an "alternative" to American leadership in security policy.
The enlargement of the EU to include a number of Central and Eastern European countries will increase resistance to Franco-German initiatives in this direction.
The letter from the eight European leaders - and the subsequent declaration by the "Vilnius Ten" group of Central and Eastern European countries - showed that France (and Germany) cannot dictate a European agenda that creates transatlantic divisions.
This has obviously caused frustration.
But it shouldn't have surprised anyone.
The division within the EU and NATO has increased the risk of armed conflict with Iraq by weakening pressure on Iraq to comply with UN resolutions.
Chirac and Schröder do not seem to understand this.
So this has not been one of Europe's finest hours, especially when the EU's institutional convention is debating a text calling on EU governments to 'actively and unreservedly support the Union's common foreign policy'.
The German abbreviation for the EU's "Common Foreign and Security Policy" is CFSP.
That seems an entirely appropriate expression of what we have been through.
Education in the Gaza Strip
GAZA < br > This was supposed to be my first year at medical school, but instead I'm stuck here in Gaza, in my father's house in the Jabalia refugee camp, with no options and no way out.
After finishing high school last year, I decided to become a doctor.
Gaza is crying out for bone specialists, but the training I need is only available abroad.
When I got a place at a medical college in Germany, my parents were proud.
I was excited to follow my older brother, who is already studying there.
In February, the German authorities granted me an entry visa.
I wasted no time in asking the Israeli authorities for permission to travel to Europe.
But I was told that only patients needing an emergency medical evacuation would be allowed out, not students.
Hundreds of other young people held captive in the Gaza Strip have been admitted to study abroad.
For many of us, this is our only way to continue our education.
Gaza is one of the most densely populated places in the world and one of the poorest of us, 1.5 million people live on a piece of land about 41 kilometres long and 6-12 kilometres wide.
Local hospitals lack the equipment to perform many important procedures, such as radiation treatments for cancer patients and heart surgery.
Gaza's universities are overcrowded and starving for supplies.
Many subjects are not even taught, and there are few postgraduate programs.
Foreign instructors are not allowed to enter Gaza.
Without the ability to go abroad, we cannot learn.
After the United States pressured Israel to allow Fulbright scholars to leave the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military announced in June that it would grant exit permits to some more students with recognized scholarships, but not hundreds.
So there are still hundreds of us, most of us without prestigious scholarships, waiting to catch the world's attention.
I am sure I will be one of the many who will not be allowed to leave.
Life in Gaza has bled away my optimism.
My father is a teacher and owner of a children's clothing store.
My mother is a housekeeper.
I have six brothers and three sisters.
We returned to Palestine in 1996 from Saudi Arabia, where my father had worked as a teacher.
That was at the height of the peace process.
My parents put their hopes in the Oslo Agreement signed in 1993 and decided that they could give us a better life here.
But when I was ten, the second intifada began.
During my teenage years, the peace process collapsed.
During my third year of school, the Israeli authorities sealed off Gaza.
Israeli border controls have reduced the flow of people crossing the border to a trickle, stifling Gaza's economy by strangling imports and exports and cutting off fuel supplies and electricity.
In my father's shop, which was supposed to support my brother and me during our studies, there are no more clothes.
With the support of the United States, Canada and the European Union, Israel has maintained its blockade in order to defeat Hamas, which won elections here in 2006.
But the blockade only makes people more desperate.
I know that Hamas and other armed groups from Gaza have launched rockets that have killed civilians in Israeli towns and villages.
But I have also seen Israel strike back with air strikes and armed attacks on Gaza, including Jabalia.
Israel's blockade amounts to collective punishment.
Whether we support Hamas or not, it hurts us all.
It is also destroying my dream of writing "specialist in bone medicine" after my name.
Sometimes I am sorry that I come from Gaza.
But my hope is still to go abroad, learn skills and come back to help others here.
Sometimes, when there is electricity, I watch TV and see how people live in other places.
I wonder why they have the opportunity to travel, to study, to go on holiday when I cannot even go abroad to learn medicine.
We are students, not soldiers.
We are not fighters in this conflict.
Why doesn't Israel let us study?
Why are Europe and America supporting a blockade of young minds?
Soon my fellow students at the medical school will start classes.
If they do, I will probably still be here in my father's house waiting for the blockade to end.
A divided gender
OXFORD - Newsweek's current cover story, "The Global Women's Progress Report 2011," conjures images of two different worlds at the top and bottom of the list of countries.
Top of the "Best Places to be a Woman" list are the usual suspects: Iceland and the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Canada.
On this planet, we find rankings in the top 90% of the survey's five categories: Justice, Health, Education, Economy and Politics.
Women earn more than men with university degrees (USA), domestic violence offenders are banned from their homes and prosecuted with electronic monitoring devices (Turkey), and female prime ministers are elected (Denmark and Australia).
Now look at the other planet, the worst places in the world to be a woman.
In Chad, the worst of the worst, women have "almost no legal rights," and girls as young as ten are legally married, as is the case in Niger, the seventh worst place for a woman.
Most women in Mali - the fifth worst - are traumatised by female genital mutilation.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, 1100 women are raped every day.
In Yemen, you are free to hit your wife whenever you want.
While it is astounding to see these two worlds in such stark and detailed terms, their existence is not news: development experts and human rights groups have been drawing attention to these injustices for years.
But systemic oppression of women tends to be seen as a claim to empathy: we should not pursue this policy because it is not nice and unenlightened.
Some development researchers have also persuasively argued that oppression of women is hampering countries "efforts to escape poverty.
But the data in the Newsweek list show that we need to formulate this issue more forcefully and comprehensively: when poor countries decide to oppress their own women, they choose to some extent their own continued poverty.
The oppression of women is a moral issue, but it must also be seen as a choice that countries make for short-term cultural comfort at the expense of long-term economic and social progress.
It is politically incorrect to attribute any proportion of very poor countries that are suffering to their own decisions.
But it is patronising not to blame many of them for their own plight.
Clearly, the legacy of colonialism - widespread hunger, illiteracy, lack of property or remedies, and vulnerability to state violence - is a major factor in their current poverty.
But how can we blame this heritage, while at the same time turning a blind eye to a kind of colonialism against women in those very countries - in private homes and public institutions?
If the poorest countries - most of them in Africa or with a Muslim majority - decide to maintain and even develop new policies that oppress women, we must be prepared to say that to some extent they are choosing the economic calamity that follows.
The developed world's silence suggests that it takes for granted the mistreatment of black and brown women by black and brown men, rather than holding all people to a standard of justice.
The "surprises" on Newsweek's list confirm that education for women increases economic prosperity.
Many countries with a history of colonialism and other forms of tyranny, as well as countries without rich mineral resources, have chosen to educate women and give them rights.
Consider China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, South Korea, and Turkey.
The low status of women on Planet Worst cannot be attributed to cultural stagnation: many of the "surprise" countries, such as Romania, Portugal, the Philippines, and India, treated women much more unequally 50-100 years ago.
In Pakistan, rape in marriage is not illegal today, and there are 800 honor killings a year.
What kind of economic boom could stagnant Pakistan experience if the patriarchy loosened its grip?
If you are not innumerable, you can start a business.
If you don't live in agony at home from rape and beatings, you can organize your community to dig a new well.
If you don't expose your daughter to three traumatic genital injuries and marry her at ten, she can go to school.
And when she marries and has children of her own, she benefits from having two educated, working parents, which means twice as much educated conversation at home, twice as many contacts, and twice as much encouragement to succeed.
Educated, pushy mothers make the difference.
As US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it in the Newsweek issue, "The world needs to think more strategically and creatively about unlocking women's growth potential.
Studies show that promoting women's access to trade and business contributes to job creation and income growth.
But on Planet Worst, forcing frightened, uneducated women to stay at home is more socially acceptable than facing up to the fact that it means lowering incomes for all.
It is time to stop riding around in the poorest countries and take responsibility for doing something essential to their own plight: emancipating their women.
A German Conservative Creed
Few concepts are as elastic as "conservatism." "
At one end of its spectrum of meaning, conservatism (for the past two decades) has moved too far to promote a bourgeois life of greed and possessiveness.
On the other hand, conservatism has historically come too close to right-wing extremism in many European countries.
In Germany today, conservatism was forged in the wake of the failure of the Weimar Republic, experiences unknown to Anglo-Saxon conservatives.
This story explains the kind of conservatism practiced by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU), which focus on moderation and balance, preservation and innovation, and dominate Germany's political center.
With German parliamentary elections due in the autumn, much will be said about the nature of German conservatism.
Some will try to portray the coalition as overshadowed by American "everything goes" market conservatism, given the CDU / CSU candidate for chancellor Edmund Stoiber's emphasis on Bavaria's economic success.
Others who point to the German conservatives' emphasis on social values will say that we are just as dirigiste as the Social Democrats.
The truth itself is much more complex than these superficial comparisons, which also makes it more durable.
CDU / CSU policy is, of course, based on the idea of individual freedom, but we believe in an individualism tempered by Western culture and Christian tradition.
We are sceptical about unrestricted individualism because we are aware of human sins, but also because we are aware of the historical mistakes and deviations in the history of Germany in the 20th century.
Yet, despite this deep-rooted skepticism of human nature, we applaud humanity's talent for progress and innovation, because we recognize man's ability to correct mistakes and errors.
While these two characteristics seem contradictory, and certainly different from the values of American and British conservatives, they provide a solid foundation for realistic pragmatism and avoidance of ideological politics - which is precisely the policy that Germany needs now.
Far from forcing people to live a certain life, German conservatives seek policies that recognize boundaries - the boundaries of the state, the market, and the individual.
We see politics as a mechanism for reconciliation of lasting conflicts, such as those between freedom and security.
Security is useless without freedom, but freedom makes no sense without security - both national security and economic security.
It is on these principles that the social market economy is based, which we continue to embrace.
It regards competition as the most effective means of promoting economic growth, but also intervenes, if necessary, in state intervention to ensure equal opportunities, social solidarity and social equilibrium, which should also help to avoid the "economization" of all aspects of civic life.
The market is merely a tool, not the answer to every human problem.
Recognizing this, German conservatives, for example, strive to strike a balance between economics and ecology. We feel responsible for the environment at the global level, which is why we disagree with unilateral decisions by individual nations when these decisions ignore the needs of the rest of the world.
Because globalisation is both a challenge and an opportunity. If we are to open ourselves to the winds of globalisation, we must also strengthen local institutions that promote social ties and identity, such as the family, local and regional communities, religious communities and the tradition of solidarity of voluntary workers - which have been neglected in recent years.
This is the principle of 'subsidiarity', which helps to transfer decision-making power, wherever and whenever possible, to the state bodies closest to the individual citizen.
This is particularly important for our vision of the European Union, where we strive for an effective balance between the nation and Europe.
For the German conservatives, European integration and national identity are not warlike concepts, as they seem to be for our opponents and so many others.
On the contrary, they are two sides of the same coin: the EU was founded on the understanding that certain objectives can only be achieved through cooperation.
Decades later, the European Union still needs the cohesion and legitimacy of its constituent nations, as well as historic regional political structures within those nations, because a common European identity is slowly emerging and cannot yet justify a single constitutional structure.
In essence, the form of government we aspire to in Germany and throughout Europe is based on a sense of moral discourse and decision-making, not on the supposedly eternal truth of an abstract political concept.
Indeed, only sustained skepticism of fashionable political nostrums - both statist and market fundamentalist - can foster pluralism and tolerance, and prevent the bureaucracy that weakens our economy from spilling over.
In a fast-changing world, this skepticism of the center is the only reasonable stance that a responsible political party and government can take.
Our political approach embraces this humane and realistic pragmatism, because only such an approach offers the chance to ensure a prosperous stability within which necessary changes can be made without ending in extremist euphoria or fear of the future.
Moderation, tolerance, and the ability to reform are the buzzwords of contemporary German conservatism.
A German Europe?
LISBON / RIGA - Is the Europe emerging from the euro crisis a German one?
During the euro crisis, power in the European Union seems to have shifted to national capitals in general, and to a national capital in particular: Berlin.
But, with Germany introverted, France demoted, and Britain half-hearted, the big story in European foreign policy is that the time has come for the little guy to think big.
In this Europe, important steps are now sometimes taken in Stockholm or Warsaw, not just in Berlin, Paris or London.
And, with major foreign-policy issues on Europe's doorstep - whether in Egypt, Belarus, or now Syria - useful European initiatives are to be welcomed, wherever they come from.
Germany can play a decisive leading role in the EU, both in foreign policy and in the economy, if it wants to.
Together with Poland, for example, it led the EU's attempt to develop a coordinated approach to Russia, flexing its muscles against Serbia.
But on other issues, such as Libya, Germany has taken less of a lead than has used its newfound leeway to follow its own preferences over other EU members.
So the answer to Henry Kissinger's famous question of whom to call if he wants to talk to Europe today is not necessarily the German Chancellor.
While Berlin is increasingly imposing its economic preferences on other eurozone countries, it is unwilling to use military force as a foreign policy tool, as demonstrated in the case of Libya.
Moreover, Germany, it seems, is becoming a geoeconomic power, owing to the needs of its export sector.
By pursuing its foreign-policy objectives by economic means, Germany is gradually turning away from its European partners.
Meanwhile, France, which is losing power relative to Germany on economic issues, continues to play a crucial role in foreign policy.
France has led the Libya operation and is doing the same with attempts to impose tougher sanctions on Iran and to support the United Nations in Côte d'Ivoire.
But France's unilateral approach often antagonizes its European partners.
For example, French President Nicolas Sarkozy pre-empted a common European position on the Palestinian state application to the United Nations in September.
In other words, even when France takes the lead, it does not always do so constructively.
Apart from the crucial role it played alongside France in Libya, Britain is increasingly playing a marginal role in European foreign policy.
Even before it vetoed a plan by eurozone countries to create a fiscal union at the EU summit in December 2011, it played less of a leadership role than it has traditionally done on key European foreign policy issues.
Britain has continued to support EU enlargement, closer ties with Turkey, and development in Africa, but has not taken creative initiatives to catch up with other member states or change the terms of the EU debate.
On other issues, too, such as engaging strategic partners such as China and Russia in particular, Britain is often a follower.
While the "Big Three" increasingly pursue their own narrow national interests, other EU member states are emerging as leaders in key foreign policy areas.
Sweden, the fourteenth largest Member State in terms of population and eighth in terms of gross domestic product, performs much better under the leadership of Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and Foreign Minister Carl Bildt.
Last year, it increased annual aid to North Africa by SEK 100 million (€11.1 million), proposed an EU mission to Tunisia just a week after the revolution to support democratic aspirations, and gave early and strong support to UN resolutions supporting the uprising in Libya.
Poland, too, is emerging as a foreign-policy leader.
Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, in particular, have taken the initiative on the EU's strategy towards Russia, where Poland has largely overcome its differences with Germany and is now at the forefront of efforts to achieve a truly comprehensive approach.
Poland has also taken a leading role in European defense (though it has refused to take part in military intervention in Libya).
This reflects the strength of the Polish economy, which is expected to grow by more than 3% in 2012 - faster than almost anywhere else in the EU.
Germany may be getting all the attention at this time of crisis, but the past year has reminded us that Europe is most effective and influential when the small countries get involved, ally with the big ones and even take the lead.
For example, on Iran (with exceptions like Greece), Europeans have agreed on a clear policy and common positions, such as an oil embargo.
So, Poland and Sweden: Europe needs your leadership.
But that may not be enough in an EU with more than 500 million citizens.
Other EU countries must follow their example in order to make European foreign policy truly effective and influential.
A German Glimmer in the Global Boom
In 2004, the world economy grew at a rate of 5.1%, the fastest pace in 28 years.
While the Ifo World Economic Climate Indicator, compiled from quarterly surveys of 1,200 experts in 90 countries, deteriorated slightly in the first three quarters of 2005, it rose again in the last quarter, indicating a continuation of the boom.
Growth was estimated at 4.3% in 2005, and a similar rate is expected in 2006, marking a period of sustained, rapid global growth not seen since the 1970 "s.
But the boom is not uniform.
In the United States, the number of experts assessing the current situation positively has decreased; in fact, a majority believe that the economic situation will deteriorate in the next six months.
In Asian countries, including China, however, optimism remains unabated.
The same is true of Eastern Europe, the former Soviet states, and Latin America.
The big surprise is Europe, which, unlike 2004 and the first half of 2005, now seems to be catching up with the rest of the world.
While growth in the 15 old Member States of the European Union was a miserable 1.5% in 2005, the Ifo Institute expects growth in the EU-15 to accelerate to 2.1% in 2006.
Of course, economic performance will vary widely between EU countries.
Whereas Italy, with only 1.1% growth, will finish last, the Irish rocket will not lose its power, boosting real GDP by about 4.8%.
In general, the large EU countries still perform poorly, as opposed to the smaller members - hardly surprising, since the EU is essentially an institution that helps smaller countries overcome the disadvantage of their size by extending the agglomeration advantages that were previously reserved for the larger countries.
But Germany, Europe's largest economy, is also experiencing an upswing.
The Ifo Climate Indicator for Germany, which is based on monthly surveys of 7,000 companies, rose sharply in the second half of 2005 and reached its highest level since the boom year 2000, with companies "assessments of the current situation and expectations improving.
After five years of stagnation, the economy is finally on the move.
The driving force is foreign demand, because Germany, the world's second-largest exporter, is benefiting from the global boom.
Exports increased by 6.2% in 2005 and are expected to increase by 7.4% in 2006.
However, as we saw in 2004 and 2005, exports will not be sufficient to generate significant growth if domestic demand does not follow.
The good news for Germany is that investment demand is now also growing.
Whereas the second half of 2005 was already quite good, the Ifo Institute expects a healthy growth in equipment investment of 6% in 2006.
After many years of slowdown, construction investment will also rise slightly.
Overall investment growth is expected to reach 2.9% by current standards, but is nevertheless a promising reassurance for the battered mood in Germany.
Moreover, any investment growth is crucial for Germany, which, according to the latest OECD statistics, currently suffers from the world's smallest share of net investment in national income.
Even if Germany remains at the bottom of the world rankings, rising investment demand as such will contribute to GDP growth, which the Ifo Institute estimates at 1.7 percent for 2006.
This figure seems small compared to most other countries.
In fact, all EU countries except Italy and the Netherlands will grow faster.
But everything is relative: Germany has a trend growth rate of only 1.1% and is the slowest-growing EU country since 1995.
Judging by a disappointing past, even Germany is experiencing an economic boom.
Indeed, even Germany's unemployment rate, which has been rising cyclically since 1970, will fall slightly from 4.8 million to 4.7 million in 2006.
The good economic data will reinforce the first positive impression of Angela Merkel's new government, which got off to an excellent start at the EU summit, where Merkel negotiated a compromise between Britain and France on the 2007-2013 EU budget (adding an additional €2 billion to Germany's annual contribution).
The government may even have contributed a little to the good economic data by announcing serious efforts to consolidate German public finances - a prerequisite for investor confidence.
According to the government, significant tax increases will push the budget deficit below the 3% of GDP threshold set by the Stability and Growth Pact - a target missed for five consecutive years until 2007.
The real test for the federal government is the labor market.
Most observers now agree that Germany needs something like the American tax credit on labor income.
In Germany, they are called "activation of social assistance" or "combination wages," but the principle is the same: the state should reduce the money it pays for doing nothing and pay more for participation in working life.
This would increase wage distribution, create jobs, and maintain the living standards of the poor.
In her inaugural address to the Bundestag, Merkel announced that her government would introduce such a system in 2006.
If this is more than lip service, and if it really undertakes a serious reform of the incentive structure of the German welfare state, the result could be higher employment and structural economic growth.
In the long term, this would be more promising for the EU and the global economy than the demand-oriented development that Germany is currently experiencing.
A Global Agenda for Seven Billions
NEW YORK - At the end of next month, a child will be born who has the seventh billion inhabitants of planet Earth.
We will never know what circumstances he or she was born into.
We know that the baby will enter a world of enormous and unpredictable environmental, economic, geopolitical, technological, and demographic change.
Since the founding of the United Nations in 1945, the world's population has tripled.
And our numbers continue to grow, with corresponding pressures on land, energy, food and water.
The global economy is also creating pressures: rising unemployment, increasing social inequalities, and the emergence of new economic powers.
These trends link the fate and future of today's seven billion people like never before.
No nation alone can solve the great global challenges of the twenty-first century.
International cooperation is a universal need.
The 66th session of the UN General Assembly is another opportunity for the world's countries to set aside narrow, short-term interests and commit to cooperative efforts to address humanity's long-term needs.
At a time when all nations face individual challenges, we must forge a common global agenda that can help the seven billionth baby and future generations grow up in a world of sustainable peace, prosperity, freedom, and justice.
To help shape that future, in my second term as Secretary-General, I will focus on five global needs and five intergenerational ways to shape tomorrow's world through the choices we make today.
The first and greatest of these needs is sustainable development.
We must all understand that saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty and promoting economic growth are one and the same fight.
We need to connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy scarcity, global health, food security and the empowerment of women.
Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all.
Over the next five years, we must develop a new economic vision for sustainable development and build a global consensus on a binding climate agreement.
Promoting economic growth, achieving the Millennium Development Goals and combating climate change will all depend on creating a new energy system for the 21st century and extending it to all the people on the planet.
Prevention as a framework for international cooperation is a second chance.
This year, the total budget for UN peacekeeping missions will be $8 billion.
Imagine what we could save by avoiding conflict, for example by using political mediation missions instead of troops.
We know how to do it.
Our record proves it in Guinea, Kenya and Kyrgyzstan.
A third commandment is to build a safer and safer world.
In this endeavour, we must courageously stand up for democracy, human rights and peace.
This year has been one of the most significant achievements in restoring and securing peace in Côte d'Ivoire, Darfur, Egypt and elsewhere.
But hatred and bloodshed still stand in the way of our vision for peace.
In the Middle East, we need to break the stalemate.
The Palestinians deserve a state.
Israel needs security.
Both want peace.
A negotiated solution can lead to these results, and the UN is a platform for forging such a peace.
We will also continue our efforts to promote democratic governance in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone.
And in the name of all humanity, we will continue to work for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in order to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.
The fourth great opportunity is to help countries in transition.
The dramatic events of this year in North Africa and the Middle East have inspired people around the world.
Let us help make the Arab Spring a true season of hope for all.
In Libya, we are deploying a new UN Assistance Mission to assist the country's transitional authorities in forming a new government and rule of law in line with the aspirations of the Libyan people.
Syria is a particular concern.
For six months we have seen an escalation of violence and repression.
A Global Consensus Against Terrorism
Mention the United Nations, and the first reaction is likely to be the ongoing oil-for-food scandal and what it will mean for Secretary-General Kofi Annan's ability to lead the organization for the remaining year and a half of his term.
But there is much more going on at the United Nations than just investigations.
Reform is in the air, partly because of the scandal, but also because of the UN's inability to address effectively the challenges from Rwanda and Kosovo to Iraq and Sudan.
Even the UN's most ardent supporters now recognize that change is needed if the organization is to make a significant contribution to international peace and security.
Part of the reform discussions concerns the composition of the UN Security Council.
The Security Council represents what the Second World War Allies believed, what the post-war world would look like, and how it should be run.
This also explains why much-weakened France has been appointed a permanent member of the Council of Europe, while Germany and Japan (and not yet independent India) have not.
Defending the current composition of the Security Council is impossible; there is no question of the need for change.
But finding an approach that has broad international support will prove extremely difficult.
Britain and France will resist being replaced by a single EU seat, while accepting Germany as a permanent member would only exacerbate the problem of Europe's relative over-representation.
Pakistan would oppose India's inclusion on the Security Council, while Argentina, Chile and Mexico would oppose Brazil's inclusion.
Nigeria to South Africa (and vice versa); and several countries, including China, Indonesia, and South Korea, may oppose the creation of a permanent seat for Japan.
The establishment of the Security Council clearly requires considerable time and political effort.
In the meantime, there are important things to do.
One productive way would be to follow one of the recommendations of the Annan-backed high-level panel, namely that all UN members put on the record that terrorism has no place in today's world.
That will be more difficult than it sounds at first.
For too long, the international community has tolerated terrorism - the deliberate killing of civilians and non-combatants by non-state actors for political purposes - on the grounds that "one terrorist is sometimes another freedom fighter."
Historians have the luxury of debating whether terrorism might have been justified in certain situations in the past.
We don't.
Modern terrorism is too destructive to be tolerated or even supported.
Weapons of mass destruction - nuclear, biological, and chemical - are precisely that, and no cause can excuse their use.
Moreover, as the terrorist attacks on America in 2001 demonstrated, weapons as simple as box cutters can become weapons of mass destruction if they are used to exploit the vulnerabilities of modern global life.
Terrorism is even less justified when one considers that today there are political ways of pursuing political objectives.
The Palestinians can negotiate their future relationship with Israel and count on American, Russian, European, and UN support.
Iraqis have elected their own representatives and are on the verge of writing their constitution.
No one with reasonable objectives and a willingness to compromise can argue that terrorism is the only option for him or his group.
The world has already taken some important steps against terrorism.
A dozen international conventions and numerous UN resolutions oblige governments to reject hostage-taking, civilian aircraft hijacking, and terrorism more broadly.
Similarly, the mandate of the Financial Action Task Force, established in 1989 to curb money laundering, has grown, focusing mainly on curbing terrorist financing.
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373, adopted after the attacks of 11 September, calls on states to deny terrorists safe havens, bring to justice anyone associated with terrorism, suppress recruitment by terrorist groups, block terrorist efforts to acquire weapons, and cooperate with other governments and international organizations to track down suspects and increase security.
What is missing is a new, 13th Convention that closes the loophole that seems to allow governments to decide what constitutes terrorism and what does not.
There must be broad agreement that any deliberate killing of civilians and non-combatants is unacceptable and that the perpetrators and supporters must be punished.
Of course, such a convention will not prevent all future acts of terrorism.
But ideas are important.
Terrorism must be delegitimised in the same way as slavery was.
This will make governments and individuals think twice before becoming a party to terrorism; it should also make it less difficult to win support for international action against those who carry it out.
Early in our lives we are taught that the end cannot sanctify the means.
It is time to implement this principle before many more innocent lives are lost.
A Global Green New Deal
NAIROBI - With soaring unemployment, rising bankruptcies, and stock markets in freefall, it may seem sensible at first to abandon the fight against climate change and put environmental investment on hold.
But that would be a disastrous mistake of immediate and generational proportions.
Far from putting a strain on the already overburdened and overstretched global economy, environmental investment is exactly what is needed to get people back to work, get order books up and running, and restore economies to health.
Environmental care used to be considered a luxury; today it is a necessity that some, but by no means all, economic architects have grasped.
Much of President Barack Obama's $825 billion stimulus package for the United States includes promoting renewable energy, weathering one million homes, and upgrading the country's inefficient power grid.
Such investments could create an estimated five million jobs, boost the construction and engineering industries, and return America to the equally serious business of combating climate change and energy security.
The Republic of Korea, which is losing jobs for the first time in more than five years, has also recognized the bleak economic times.
President Lee Myung-Bak's government wants to invest $38 billion to clean up four major rivers and reduce disaster risks by building dams and water treatment plants.
Other elements of Lee's plan include the construction of environmentally friendly transport networks such as high-speed railways and hundreds of kilometres of cycle paths, as well as generating energy from waste methane from landfills.
The package also focuses on investment in hybrid vehicle technologies.
Similar employment-friendly "Green New Deal" packages have been rolled out in China, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
They are equally relevant to developing countries in terms of jobs, poverty alleviation, and creating new opportunities at a time of increasingly uncertain commodity prices and exports.
In South Africa, the government-backed Working for Water initiative, which employs more than 30,000 people, including women, young people and the disabled, also sees opportunities in the crisis.
The country spends about $60 million annually to combat invasive alien plants that threaten native wildlife, water supplies, major tourist destinations, and farmland.
This work will continue as more than 40 million tonnes of invasive alien plants are harvested for power plant fuel.
This will generate an estimated 500 megawatts of electricity, equivalent to 2% of the country's electricity needs, and create more than 5,000 jobs.
So it is clear that some countries see environmental investment in infrastructure, energy systems, and ecosystems as one of the best opportunities for recovery.
Others may be uncertain about the potential returns from investments in ecosystem services, such as forest carbon storage or renewable energy, for the 80% of Africans who lack access to electricity.
Still others may simply not know exactly how to follow this example.
In early February, the United Nations Environment Programme will convene some of the world's leading economists at UN headquarters in New York.
A strategy for a Global Green New Deal, tailored to different national challenges, is being developed to help leaders and ministers put together stimulus packages that work on several fronts.
The Global Green New Deal, which UNEP launched as a concept in October 2008, responds to the current economic malaise.
But, wisely spent, these stimulus packages could trigger far-reaching and transformative trends and lay the groundwork for a more sustainable, much-needed green economy for the twenty-first century.
The trillions of dollars mobilized to address today's needs, along with the trillions of investors and dollars waiting in the wings, represent an opportunity that would have been unthinkable 12 months ago: the chance to steer a more resource-efficient and intelligent course that can address issues ranging from climate change and scarcity of natural resources to water scarcity and biodiversity loss.
Bluntly pumping the current bailout billions into old industries and exhausted economic models will throw good money after bad, while mortgaging our children's futures.
Instead, policymakers must use these windfalls to invest in innovation, promote sustainable businesses, and promote new patterns of decent, long-term employment.
A Global Perfect Storm
NEW YORK - Dark clouds are rising over financial markets and the economy, it seems, from all directions: the eurozone, the United States, China, and elsewhere.
In fact, the global economy in 2013 could be a very difficult environment in which to find refuge.
For starters, the eurozone crisis is worsening as the euro remains too strong, early austerity deepens recession in many member countries, and a credit crunch in the periphery and high oil prices undermine prospects for recovery.
The eurozone banking system is being balkanized, with cross-border and interbank loans being cut, and capital flight could turn into a full-blown run on peripheral banks if, as is likely, Greece embarks on a disorderly exit from the euro in the next few months.
Moreover, fiscal and sovereign debt pressures are worsening, as interest-rate spreads on Spain and Italy have returned to their unsustainable peaks.
Indeed, the eurozone may require not only an international bank bailout (as recently happened in Spain), but also a full government bailout at a time when the firewalls of the eurozone and the international community are insufficient to save both Spain and Italy.
As a result, a disorderly break-up of the eurozone remains possible.
Further west, U.S. economic output is weakening, with growth in the first quarter well below potential at a meager 1.9 percent.
And job creation stalled in April and May, with the US likely to stall by the end of the year.
Worse, the risk of a double-dip recession next year is rising: even if the looming US fiscal cliff proves to be only a minor drag, the likely increase in some taxes and reduction in some transfers will reduce growth in disposable income and consumption.
Moreover, the political gridlock on fiscal adjustment is likely to persist, regardless of whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney wins the November presidential election.
As a result, new struggles over the debt ceiling, the threat of a government shutdown, and rating downgrades could further reduce consumer and business confidence, reduce spending, and accelerate a flight to safety that would exacerbate the stock-market crash.
In the East, China, whose growth model is unsustainable, may be underwater by 2013, as its investment decline continues and reforms aimed at boosting consumption come too little and too late.
A new Chinese leadership must accelerate structural reforms to reduce national saving and increase consumption's share of GDP, but leadership disagreements over the pace of reform, as well as the likelihood of a bumpy political transition, suggest that reforms will occur at a pace that is simply not fast enough.
The slowdown in the US, the eurozone, and China, owing to their trade and financial ties with the US and the European Union, is already severely slowing growth in other emerging economies (i.e., there has been no decoupling).
At the same time, the lack of structural reforms in emerging markets, together with their move toward stronger state capitalism, will hamper growth and reduce their resilience.
Finally, long-simmering tensions in the Middle East between Israel and the US, on the one hand, and Iran, on the other, could reach a boiling point by 2013 on nuclear proliferation.
The current negotiations are likely to fail, and even tougher sanctions could not prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
With the US and Israel unwilling to accept deterrence to contain a nuclear Iran, a military confrontation in 2013 would lead to a massive rise in the price of oil and a global recession.
These risks are already exacerbating the economic downturn: stock markets are falling everywhere, leading to negative wealth effects on consumption and investment spending.
Borrowing costs for highly indebted countries are rising, credit rationing is undermining small and medium-sized enterprises, and falling commodity prices are reducing the income of exporting countries.
Increasing risk aversion leads economic actors to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, which makes the downturn partly self-fulfilling.
Compared to 2008-2009, when policymakers had ample room for maneuver, monetary and fiscal authorities are running out of political balls (or, more cynically, the political rabbits they were supposed to pull out of the hat).
Monetary policy is constrained by the proximity of zero interest rates and repeated rounds of quantitative easing.
Indeed, economies and markets no longer face liquidity problems, but rather credit and insolvency crises.
Meanwhile, unsustainable budget deficits and public debt in most advanced economies have severely limited the scope for further fiscal stimulus.
Using exchange rates to boost net exports is a zero-sum game at a time when private and public debt reduction suppresses domestic demand in countries with current-account deficits and structural problems in surplus countries have the same effect.
After all, a weaker currency and a better balance of trade in some countries necessarily imply a stronger currency and a weaker balance of trade in others.
Meanwhile, the ability to rescue, hedge, and shield banks and other financial institutions is constrained by policymakers and insolvent governments that are unable to absorb additional losses from their banking systems.
As a result, sovereign risk is now becoming bank risk.
Indeed, sovereigns, especially in the eurozone, dump more of their sovereign debt on banks "balance sheets.
To avoid a disorderly outcome in the eurozone, today's austerity measures should be much more gradual, a growth pact should complement the new EU fiscal compact, and a fiscal union with debt mutualization (Eurobonds) should be introduced.
Moreover, a full banking union should be initiated, starting with deposit insurance throughout the eurozone, and steps toward greater political integration must be considered, even if Greece leaves the eurozone.
Unfortunately, Germany balks at all these important policy measures, because it is fixated on the credit risk that its taxpayers would face if economic, fiscal, and banking integration were to intensify.
As a result, the likelihood of catastrophe in the eurozone is increasing.
A Global Network for Solutions
NEW YORK - Major social changes are occurring in several ways.
A technological breakthrough - steam engine, computer, Internet - could play a leading role.
Visionaries such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela could inspire the demand for justice.
Political leaders could lead a broad reform movement, as with Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal.
Our own generation urgently needs to usher in a new era of great social change.
This time, we must act to save the planet from a man-made environmental disaster.
Each of us feels this challenge almost every day.
Heatwaves, droughts, floods, forest fires, retreating glaciers, polluted rivers, and extreme storms are hitting the planet at a dramatically increasing rate due to human activity.
Our $70 trillion global economy is putting unprecedented pressure on the natural environment.
We will need new technologies, behaviors, and ethics based on solid evidence to reconcile further economic development with environmental sustainability.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon accepts this unprecedented challenge from his unique position at the crossroads of global politics and society.
At the political level, the United Nations is the meeting place for 193 member states to negotiate and create international law, as in the important Treaty on Climate Change adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992.
At the level of world society, the UN represents world citizenship, "we the peoples," as the UN Charter says.
At the social level, the UN is about the rights and duties of all of us, including future generations.
Over the past two decades, governments have found too few solutions to environmental threats.
Politicians have failed to implement properly the Treaties adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit.
Ban knows that decisive government action remains crucial, but he also recognizes that civil society must play a greater role, especially because too many governments and politicians are beholden to vested interests, and too few politicians think beyond the next election.
To empower world society, Ban has launched a bold new global initiative, for which I am grateful.
The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network is a powerful effort to mobilize global knowledge to save the planet.
The idea is to use global knowledge and action networks to identify and demonstrate new, innovative approaches to sustainable development around the world.
The network will work with and support governments, UN agencies, civil society organizations, and the private sector.
Humanity must learn new ways to produce and use low-carbon energy, grow food sustainably, build livable cities, and manage the world's oceans, biodiversity, and atmosphere.
But time is short.
Mega-cities are already struggling with dangerous heat waves, rising sea levels, more extreme storms, extreme congestion, and air and water pollution.
Agricultural regions already need to become more resilient in the face of increasing climate volatility.
And, as a region in one part of the world develops a better way to manage its transport, energy, water, or food supplies, these successes should quickly become part of the global knowledge base, allowing other regions to benefit quickly.
Universities have a special role to play in the new UN knowledge network.
Exactly 150 years ago, in 1862, Abraham Lincoln created America's "land grant universities" to help local communities improve agriculture and quality of life through science.
Today, we need universities in all parts of the world to help their societies meet the challenges of poverty reduction, clean energy, sustainable food, and others.
By networking and publishing their curricula online, universities around the world can become even more effective in finding and promoting science-based solutions to complex problems.
The global corporate sector also plays an important role in sustainable development.
Now the corporate sector has two faces.
It is a hotbed of pioneering sustainable technologies, pioneering research and development, first-class management and leadership in the field of environmental sustainability.
At the same time, however, the corporate sector is aggressively engaged in undermining environmental regulations, lowering corporate tax rates, and shirking its own responsibility for environmental degradation.
Sometimes the same company operates on both sides of the divide.
We urgently need farsighted companies to join the Sustainable Development Solutions Network.
These companies are uniquely able to translate new ideas and technologies into early demonstration projects, accelerating global learning cycles.
Equally important, we need a critical mass of respected business leaders to urge their colleagues to end the environmental lobby and campaign finance practices that are responsible for governments "inaction.
Sustainable development is a generational challenge, not a short-term one.
The reinvention of energy, food, transport, and other systems will take decades, not years.
But the long-term nature of this challenge must not lull us into inaction.
We must now begin to reinvent our production systems, precisely because the road to change will be so long and the environmental dangers so pressing.
At the Rio + 20 Summit last June, world leaders agreed to adopt new post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals to build on the Millennium Development Goals - reducing poverty, hunger, and disease.
In the post-2015 period, the fight against poverty and the fight to protect the environment will go hand in hand and reinforce each other.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has already launched several global processes to help set the new post-2015 goals in an open, participatory, and knowledge-based manner.
The Secretary-General's launch of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network is therefore particularly timely.
A good rate rise for Europe
Two mistakes do not make a right.
Just because European governments have failed to put bread on the table for their voters does not mean that the European Central Bank should also fail in its task of promoting price stability in the eurozone.
This may sound obvious, but the task of price stability is exactly what some European politicians advocate.
For example, Italian politicians who, given Italy's recent dismal economic performance, seem least suited to advising the ECB on monetary policy are nonetheless advocating interest rate cuts.
Echoing comments made by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Deputy Economy Minister Mario Baldassarri said in Il Sole 24 Ore last week that all efforts to stimulate growth are futile "if someone steps on the brake pedal."
Who is he kidding?
If anyone is putting the brakes on Italy's growth, it is Berlusconi himself.
He made no effort to reform the economy during his term of office, and is now trying to blame the ECB for Italy's sluggish economic performance.
But it is precisely the lack of economic reform at home that has made Italy one of the least competitive states in the eurozone economy.
This is about more than the usual blame game.
Pressure is mounting on the ECB to raise interest rates, and Berlusconi and Co.'s attacks are as much an attempt to prevent future interest-rate hikes as to induce the ECB to loosen monetary policy.
Rising energy prices, for example, have become a leading inflation risk.
But higher energy prices alone will not force the ECB to act on the interest-rate trigger.
So-called "second-round effects" will determine whether rising crude oil prices lead to higher wage demands by unions.
So far, the "social partners," as ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet likes to call the unions, have held back.
If that changes, the ECB will have to raise interest rates, even if Europe's economic growth remains weak.
The good news is that economic growth is picking up in the eurozone (even in Italy).
Although GDP growth in the second quarter was weak, the eurozone average was only 0.3% year-on-year, third-quarter data suggest a sustained economic recovery in the second half of the year.
Only consumption is lagging behind.
How will the ECB respond to better economic news?
Some members of the ECB's Governing Council have become uncomfortable that eurozone interest rates have remained so low at 2% for so long (more than two years).
While there is no inflation problem in the short term, the ECB's monetary policy is focused in the medium term.
A particular concern is that the money supply in the eurozone is well above the ECB benchmark, suggesting a liquidity oversupply.
It is doubtful that the ECB would raise interest rates to contain excess liquidity while economic recovery is in question.
Slow growth has silenced the monetarists on the Governing Council.
However, this will change as soon as the economic recovery is confirmed.
Raising interest rates may come sooner rather than later, which is why Berlusconi and French President Jacques Chirac are now discussing rate cuts.
Meanwhile, Germany's election in September could have surprising consequences for the ECB's monetary policy.
Angela Merkel, the Christian Democrats "candidate, is a reformer who offers hope for the future of Germany and Europe.
Unfortunately, Merkel's campaign has got off to a bumpy start, and the recent entry of Oskar Lafontaine's far-left party into the campaign may require the formation of a grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats.
That would be bad news for the German economy, which could delay possible ECB rate hikes.
Because the expected gridlock in parliament would make reforms less likely, businesses would be able to defer investment, while consumers would be more likely to keep their wallets closed, because official policies would be even less clear than they are now.
On the other hand, a center-right coalition of Christian Democrats and Free Democrats could spur the ECB into action.
This raises an interesting point.
The public should be relieved when the ECB raises interest rates, because this would most likely signal that the long-awaited economic recovery is well underway and that the inflationary effects are being addressed.
In other words, an increase would indicate that good things are happening.
But the public often views interest-rate hikes as negative events that increase unemployment and choke off growth.
Recriminating politicians like Berlusconi, who have failed to put bread on the table, their media cronies, and Keynesian economics professors who do not understand and misrepresent Keynes, maintain this distorted view.
Europe would be much better off if someone told the public the truth.
A grand bargain with Iran
The specter of a nuclear Iran haunts Arabs and Israelis alike, but it is the United States and Israel that are the driving force behind efforts to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.
In the America-Iran-Israel triangle lies the reference to the problem and its possible solution.
Although Ayatollah Khomeini's 1979 Islamic revolution shattered Israel's old alliance with Iran, the two countries continued to do business with America's blessing.
The Iran-Contra affair of the 1980 "s, in which Israel supplied arms to the Islamic Republic in the war against Iraq, is a case in point.
Israel and Iran, two non-Arab powers in a hostile Arab environment, shared fundamental interests that the Islamic revolution could not change.
It was during Yitzhak Rabin's government in the early 1990 "s that Israel and Iran came into open conflict, owing to the changing strategic environment following America's victory in the First Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The US-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace process, which produced a series of stunning achievements - the Madrid Peace Conference, the Oslo Accords, Israel's peace deal with Jordan, a near-rapprochement with Syria, and Israel's incursion into Arab states from Morocco to Qatar - has been an increasingly isolated nightmare for Iran.
At this crossroads, Israel and Iran, two powers vying for supremacy in a rapidly changing Middle East, decided to frame their strategic competition in ideological terms.
The conflict was now between Israel, a beacon of democracy fighting the expansion of a Shiite, obscurantist empire, and Iran, which decided to protect its revolution by mobilizing the Arab masses in the name of Islamic values and against traitorous rulers who had betrayed the dispossessed Palestinians.
The mullahs, who are more of an enemy of Israeli-Arab reconciliation than of Israel itself, are resorting to inflammatory anti-Jewish, pan-Islamic discourse aimed at ending Iran's isolation and making its regional ambitions palatable to the Sunni masses.
In an Arab Middle East, Iran is the natural enemy; in an Islamic world, Iran is a potential leader.
Ironically, Iran has been the main backer of Arab democracy, because the best way to undermine incumbent regimes is to promote popular Islamist movements such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas in Palestine, and the Shiite majority in Iraq.
Yitzhak Rabin believed that an Israeli-Arab peace could prevent a nuclear Iran, but now his nightmare seems to be fast approaching.
As an anti-status quo power, Iran pursues nuclear capability not to destroy Israel, but to gain prestige and influence in a hostile environment and as a shield for its challenge to the regional order.
But Israel has every reason to worry, because a nuclear Iran would undermine Zionism's promise to secure a Jewish sanctuary - the core rationale of Israel's own strategy of "nuclear ambiguity" - and embolden its enemies throughout the region.
It would also trigger uncontrolled regional nuclear proliferation, with Saudi Arabia and Egypt taking the lead.
A military attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is too dangerous and its consequences uncertain.
And, however severe the economic sanctions may be, they may not bring Iran to its knees.
Nor is it clear that splitting the Iranian elite into revolutionary purists and merchant-minded ones would lead to regime change any time soon.
But being radical does not necessarily mean being irrational, and revolutionary Iran has often demonstrated its pragmatism.
In the American-Iranian equation, it was the US, not Iran, that engaged in rigid ideological diplomacy.
Iran supported the US during the first Gulf War, but was sidelined at the Madrid peace conference.
Iran also supported America in its war to drive out the Taliban in Afghanistan.
And when US forces overran Saddam Hussein's army in the spring of 2003, the encircled Iranians proposed a grand bargain that would put all contentious issues on the table, from the nuclear issue to Israel, from Hezbollah to Hamas.
The Iranians also committed themselves to ending the blockade of the Israeli-Arab peace process.
But neoconservative hubris - "We are not talking to evil" - ruled out a pragmatic response to Iran's demarche.
The mood in Iran changed when America's entire Middle East strategy got out of hand, but the grand bargain remains the only viable way out of the impasse.
But this would not be achieved by an inevitably imperfect sanctions regime, or by America's recourse to the Cold War logic of breaking Iran's backbone by dragging it into a ruinous arms race.
Iran's growing regional influence stems not from its military spending, which is much lower than that of its enemies, but from its challenge to America and Israel through the skilful use of soft power.
There is no better way to undermine Iran's regional destabilization strategy than a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, accompanied by massive investment in human development, followed by an internationally promoted peace and security system in a demonstrably nuclear-free Middle East, including Israel.
A Gravitational Test for the Euro
CAMBRIDGE - While I know that exchange rates are never easy to explain or understand, I find today's relatively robust value of the euro somewhat mysterious.
Do monetary authorities seriously believe that the latest "comprehensive package" of eurozone governments to save the euro will last for more than a few months?
The new plan relies on a dubious mix of dubious financial tricks and vague promises of modest Asian funding.
Even the best part of the plan, the proposed (but not really agreed) 50% haircut for private creditors of Greek government bonds, is not enough to stabilize the country's deep debt and growth problems.
So how can it be that the euro is trading at a 40% premium to the US dollar, even as investors continue to view southern European government bonds with deep skepticism?
I can think of one very good reason why the euro must fall, and six less convincing reasons why it should remain stable or appreciate.
Let's start with why the euro must fall.
Without a clear path to much closer fiscal and political union, which can only be achieved through constitutional change, the current center of the euro system appears increasingly untenable.
It seems clear that the European Central Bank will be forced to buy much larger quantities of eurozone government bonds (junk bonds).
This may work in the short term, but if default risks arise, as my research with Carmen Reinhart suggests, the ECB will in turn have to be recapitalized.
And if the stronger northern eurozone countries do not want to digest this transfer, and political resistance is strong, the ECB may be forced to recapitalize through money creation.
Either way, the risk of a deep financial crisis is high.
In view of this, what are the arguments in favour of the current value of the euro or its further rise?
First, investors might say that, in the worst-case scenario, northern European countries will crowd out the weaker countries, creating a super-euro.
But, while there is some truth to this scenario, a breakup would certainly be highly traumatic, as the euro would crash before it recovered from its rump shape.
Second, investors might remember that, although the dollar was at the epicenter of the financial panic of 2008, the consequences were so far-reaching that, paradoxically, the dollar actually appreciated.
While it may be difficult to connect the dots, it is entirely possible that a huge euro crisis in the US and elsewhere could have a snowball effect.
Perhaps the transmission mechanism would lie with US banks, many of which remain vulnerable, owing to their thin capitalization and vast portfolios of mortgages written well above their market value.
Third, foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds may be interested in continuing to buy euros to hedge against risks to the US and its own economies.
Government investors are not necessarily driven by the yield-maximizing calculus that motivates private investors.
If official demand from abroad is the real reason for the euro's strength, there is a risk that foreign buyers of sovereign euros, like private investors, will end up fleeing faster and more concentrated.
Fourth, investors may believe that the risks are ultimately as great in the US as they are in Europe.
True, the US political system appears to be hampered from putting forward a plan to stabilize medium-term budget deficits.
While the US Congress supercommittee tasked with formulating a fiscal-consolidation package is likely to come up with a proposal, it is far from clear whether Republicans or Democrats will be willing to compromise in an election year.
Investors may also be concerned that the US Federal Reserve could launch a third round of quantitative easing, which would push the dollar lower.
Fifthly, the current value of the euro on a purchasing power basis does not appear to be entirely out of kilter.
An exchange rate of 1.4: 1 dollars is cheap for Germany's export power, which might work well even with a much stronger euro.
For the eurozone's southern periphery, however, the current euro exchange rate is very difficult to manage.
Whereas some German companies persuaded workers to accept wage cuts to weather the financial crisis, wages in the southern periphery have risen steadily, even as productivity has stagnated.
But, because the euro's aggregate value must be a balance between the north and south of the eurozone, it can be argued that 1.4 is in a reasonable range.
After all, investors may simply believe that the latest plan of eurozone leaders will work, even though the last dozen have failed. Abraham Lincoln is credited with saying, "You can deceive some all the time and others all the time, but you can't deceive everyone all the time."
A comprehensive euro solution will surely come for some countries at some point, but not for all countries anytime soon.
So, yes, there are many vaguely plausible reasons why, despite its protracted crisis, the euro has remained so firm against the dollar.
A Greek safety net
BUENOS AIRES: Desperate times bring desperate measures.
The latest package to deal with Greece's insolvency involves a bond buy-back to ease the country's debt burden.
Essentially, it is a backdoor debt restructuring: the European rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), would lend Greece the money to buy back its own debt on the secondary market at large discounts, thereby imposing a loss on private bondholders without having to declare default.
A recurring feature of the European debt crisis debate is a Latin American precedent.
Indeed, many highly indebted countries in Latin America undertook similar debt buybacks in the late 1980 "s.
A classic example is Bolivia's repurchase of nearly half of its default-prone sovereign debt in 1988, an operation financed by international donors.
But the most relevant Latin American experience of debt repurchases is a newer and far less studied case: Ecuador in 2008.
President Rafael Correa had flirted with insolvency since the 2006 presidential election campaign (debt relief was part of his election platform) and quickly acquired a CCC rating from Fitch.
The reasons cited by Correa (legal concerns about the way the bonds were issued in 2000) missed the point.
The default threat was a way to drive down bond prices in secondary markets, only to buy them back through the back door at a discount.
That task was outsourced to Banco del Pacífico, which bought the soon-to-be-bankrupt Ecuadorian paper at 20 cents to the dollar and above - a level low enough for a deep haircut, but high enough to ward off vulture investors.
In order to speed things up, Ecuador, after declaring itself insolvent in December 2008, concluded the repurchase with a reverse auction for the remaining bondholders, which should be settled in cash, and not with a regular exchange in which the legality of covert purchases is likely to be called into question.
With most of the outstanding shares in friendly hands and institutional bondholders under pressure to liquidate their positions in the midst of Lehman Brothers "bankruptcy, the operation was a success.
This episode offers some initial lessons on debt buybacks.
The first concerns the reaction of the market.
Judging by recent developments in Ecuadorian bond yields, markets do not seem to have punished Ecuador's behavior: Ecuador, an oil exporter blessed with a 2009 oil-price recovery, could have returned to capital markets shortly after the exchange.
This is particularly noteworthy, given that Ecuador was perhaps the first opportunistic default in recent history (triggered by unwillingness to pay, not insolvency).
The second lesson that is most relevant to Europe today concerns the crucial role played by the default scenario.
Indeed, nearly two years of impending default by Correa were not enough to trigger a deep discount.
Ecuador had to wait until a credit event in December 2008 to buy the bonds at bargain prices.
The premise that only a credible default ensures significant private-sector involvement (i.e., that private bondholders take a real hit) becomes apparent when we compare Uruguay's market-friendly debt exchange in 2003 with Argentina's draconian 2005 restructuring.
In Uruguay, what the authorities presented as a voluntary transaction resulted in no nominal haircuts and little debt relief; in Argentina, a four-year debt moratorium was essential to achieve nominal debt relief above 50%.
So how can private bondholders be persuaded to sell their Greek bonds at a loss if there is a credible buyer of last resort?
If Europe credibly provided voluntary funds to buy back all Greek debt, the Greek risk premium would disappear and private investors would be fully bailed out.
Only the likelihood of default and the goal of avoiding even deeper haircuts can induce investors to liquidate their positions at a discount.
But the buyback can only succeed if the market sees it as a last chance before unilateral debt restructuring.
In other words, a successful buyback is a preamble to a default.
Can Greece get debt relief through the EFSF while avoiding default?
Small purchases at current vulture-fund-style panic prices are always possible, but do not promise substantial debt relief.
Large purchases would drive up prices on the secondary market, thereby destroying the whole point of the project.
And the opaque Ecuadorian methods are not possible in Europe, both for legal reasons and because a transaction of this magnitude could hardly be disguised or outsourced.
But what if the EFSF transparently imitated Banco del Pacífico, for example, by imposing a threshold premium at which it would finance buybacks of Greek bonds on the market?
Of course, the spread automatically approaches the threshold, but how much would be sold?
Would the EFSF retire Greek bonds at bargain prices, or would it offer insurance to current bondholders?
If the threshold premium is set reasonably high to achieve a significant discount, the level of debt deducted from the buyback would be marginal.
Finally, by limiting risk spreads, the repurchase facility would limit downside risk, while providing incentives to hold the bonds and wait for the upside - perhaps a good reason to make the facility a temporary offer.
By contrast, if the threshold is set low enough to reduce panic-level risk premia, the purchases will be substantial, but at the expense of a significant reduction in the effective haircut for private creditors.
A debt buyback is something of a Catch 22: to achieve a haircut, the country must benefit from the default fears that it wants to alleviate.
Without Ecuador's tricks, buybacks do not seem to be the solution to Greece's debt overhang.
An Arab Marshall Plan
OXFORD - The wave of revolts that swept the Arab world two years ago was fueled by demands for freedom, bread, and social justice.
But, while revolutions toppled dictators and transformed societies, these core goals remain as distant as ever.
Indeed, the economic challenges facing the Arab Spring countries have become even more pressing, weighing heavily on their political prospects.
Unemployment has almost doubled in Tunisia and Egypt, and foreign direct investment has dried up across the Arab world.
Revenue from tourism, while robust, is declining, and fiscal challenges remain significant.
But the economic urgency is not reflected in the political response, which has been painfully slow or even absent.
For example, Egypt's budget deficit will exceed 11% of GDP this year.
But the country's leaders are stalling on the terms of a much-needed loan from the International Monetary Fund.
The government's cut in fuel subsidies last year was followed by no further reforms, and the requested tax increase was postponed shortly after President Mohammed Morsi's announcement.
Almost all political actors in Egypt, as in the other Arab transition countries, recognize the need for economic reform.
But neither citizens nor politicians seem willing to bear the social and political costs.
In a charged and uncertain political climate, in which new crises erupt every day, it is not surprising that economic reforms have been repeatedly postponed.
Politicians know that macroeconomic stabilization and social cohesion can be incompatible in the short term.
In a country like Egypt, where 40% of per capita income is spent on food, cutting food and energy subsidies to reduce the fiscal burden is unlikely to meet with goodwill.
Policies therefore constrain efforts to strengthen public finances.
At the same time, tight IMF rules threaten to exacerbate political instability, as citizens are no longer afraid to take to the streets to demonstrate their discontent.
The current stalemate over economic reform highlights a broader point: subsidy and tax systems cannot be reformed without first redefining the underlying social contract that has long swapped the distribution of benefits for political tolerance.
But such a move is far too risky for a single politician, or even a single country, at a time of economic uncertainty and high unemployment.
To create the political space for economic reform, Arab leaders must sign a regional growth pact, a kind of Marshall Plan that would allow for significant new investment to revive economic activity.
It is much easier to reform subsidy programs when the economy is growing.
Moreover, building competitive markets is essential to ensure sustainable GDP growth.
To this end, regional barriers to trade, which are more prevalent in the Arab world than even in sub-Saharan Africa, must be dismantled.
By agreeing to the pact, Arab countries would commit to reforming their subsidy systems and reducing restrictions on cross-border trade.
The regional dimension of prosperity has long been ignored in the Arab world.
But weak regional linkages limit the growth potential of small businesses, forcing them to rely on government patronage.
Though Arab leaders often call Turkey a beacon of hope, they seldom acknowledge that the country's recent transformation from the "sick man of Europe" to one of the world's fastest-growing emerging markets would not have been possible without regional synergies.
Such links are particularly important for Egypt and Tunisia, which will struggle to reduce unemployment if Libya's labor market, which has traditionally welcomed migrants from its North African neighbors, is not reopened.
And, while Tunisia's situation seems most promising, a crippling lack of investment threatens to derail reform efforts there.
With Europe in crisis, capital flows from Tunisia's resource-rich Arab neighbors are its best hope.
Moreover, Arab countries must increase their development spending.
Given that existing development banks in the region have largely failed to act as a vehicle of coordination and engagement, a new institution similar to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development would need to be created to oversee regional assistance and bear the costs of economic change.
New investment vehicles, such as sovereign wealth funds and Islamic finance, can help finance credit-hungry companies.
At the same time, Arab countries must streamline their current relief efforts.
For too long, Arab governments have simply poured money into problems, while rich Gulf states have effectively subsidized their troubled neighbors with public services.
Over the past two years, Saudi Arabia has provided more than $3 billion to Yemen.
Qatar has provided $5 billion to Egypt since 2011, with a further $3 billion pledged.
And the United Arab Emirates recently pledged $2.5 billion to Bahrain.
But unconditional aid delays reform only because it weakens fiscal constraints, reducing pressure on policymakers and creating a moral hazard.
The Arab Spring has exposed fault lines that run not just through individual countries, but across the region as a whole.
This requires a redefinition of relations not only between citizens and states, but also between Arab countries.
Above all, it is no longer wise to divide Arab countries into donors and recipients, or into resource-rich and resource-poor countries.
It is in the interest of the entire region - including those countries that do not appear to be directly threatened by revolt - to help revitalize their neighbors and facilitate their political transition.
A lesson in history for Koizumi
China and South Korea are once again protesting Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's annual visit to the Yasukuni Shrine.
Koizumi's insistence on paying homage to the war dead buried in Yasukuni, where convicted World War II war criminals are buried, has damaged relations with Japan's neighbors for years.
Indeed, Chinese President Hu Jintao has repeatedly reiterated that he will not hold a summit with a Japanese prime minister traveling to Yasukuni, which most Chinese see as a glorification of past Japanese aggression and colonialism.
Even some in Japan are becoming critical of Koizumi.
While public opinion remains negative about China's outbursts against Japan, a recent survey shows that more than 70% of Japanese view the current state of Sino-Japanese relations as unacceptable.
Koizumi's annual pilgrimage to Yasukuni is not supported by more people, with seven former prime ministers jointly demanding that he refrain from visiting.
But Koizumi remains defiant.
Moreover, Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe, the front-runner to succeed him, has openly stated that he will continue to visit the shrine as prime minister.
Foreign Minister Taro Aso, another possible successor to Koizumi, has called on the Japanese emperor to pray at Yasukuni.
So pessimism seems to be leveling off, and the stalemate on the Yasukuni issue seems to be deepening.
But the past can bring us more than just problems of this kind. Even on the question of Yasukuni, positive lessons can be learned.
Consider Yasuhiro Nakasone, Koizumi's predecessor in the 1980 "s.
Both are masterful politicians who remained popular and served long terms.
Both are conservative and nationalist, advocating constitutional revision and Japan's assertive political and military role abroad.
After all, both are pro-American: Nakasone declares Japan America's "unsinkable aircraft carrier" in East Asia, and Koizumi sends troops to Iraq to support the US-led war effort.
But one crucial difference between Nakasone and Koizumi is often overlooked: their handling of the Yasukuni controversy and relations with China.
Nakasone broke the taboo by becoming the first Prime Minister to hold a service at Yasukuni Shrine in his official capacity on August 15, 1985, the fortieth anniversary of the end of World War II.
The decision sparked a fierce reaction from China, where students demonstrated against his visit.
Bilateral relations have been frozen.
But, rather than capitalize on domestic displeasure with China's criticism, Nakasone decided not to visit the Yasukuni again.
He chose to improve relations with China by focusing on the positive aspects of bilateral relations.
In 1986, at the personal invitation of the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Hu Yaobang, Nakasone travelled to Beijing and laid the foundations for a Sino-Japanese youth exchange centre and promised to establish future friendships with China.
This sincere embrace of reconciliation provided much-needed support for China's leaders, who were anxious to contain anti-Japanese sentiment.
Hu praised Nakasone's courage and publicly warned Chinese youth that if they think only of their own country's well-being, they are not sober patriots.
Nakasone emerged from the crisis and was recognized as a capable statesman in the management of Japanese diplomacy with China.
There was no suggestion that Nakasone sold himself to Beijing.
Nor has his conservative, nationalist, and pro-American reputation been tarnished.
This episode suggests that Koizumi's hardline position is not the only option.
A Japanese prime minister can be strong without exploiting domestic resentment of the country's neighbors; he can be conservative, patriotic, and pro-American, while building a healthy working relationship with China.
Indeed, suspending the Yasukuni visits would likely open the door to the long-overdue Sino-Japanese summit, which could in turn empower moderate voices in China seeking a forward-looking relationship with Japan.
Unfortunately, Koizumi and his allies are unwilling to move forward on the Yasukuni issue.
As Foreign Minister Aso put it recently, "The more China expresses [opposition], the more one feels like going there.
It's like saying, "Don't smoke cigarettes, it actually makes you want to smoke."
No one expects current Japanese and Chinese leaders to embrace each other, as Nakasone and Hu did two decades ago, but it is a sad state of affairs when the leaders of neighboring giants pretend not to see each other in international forums.
If Nakasone, who is now calling on Koizumi to stop the Yasukuni pilgrimage, responded to Aso, he could simply extend the analogy: it is not in Japan's national interest to continue inhaling Koizumi's second-hand smoke.
A Human Rights Tribunal for Africa
One crucial lesson to be learned from a century of establishing international courts is that getting things right from the start is crucial.
Without fanfare, 25 January 2004 marked a milestone in the history of the protection of human rights in Africa: the entry into force of the Protocol establishing the African Court of Human Rights.
After Europe and America, Africa will be the third continent with a regional court to deal with human rights violations.
The adoption of the Protocol last year by such influential African countries as Algeria, South Africa and Libya gave the final and sudden impetus to the establishment of the Court, and the critical threshold of fifteen ratifications was reached just before the New Year, when the Comoros signed.
But it is precisely in countries such as Burundi, Côte d'Ivoire, Rwanda and Uganda, which have all ratified the Protocol, that the Court is likely to play an important role in monitoring human rights violations.
It can do so because the judgments of the Court of Justice will be legally binding and therefore enforceable before national courts.
In states that have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice, individuals will be able to appeal directly to the Court and even bring actions against their own governments.
African non-governmental organisations will be able to ask the Court for its opinion, which will strengthen the effectiveness of the African human rights regime.
Of course, the birth of an African human rights court should be celebrated.
But it is in danger of failing in the docks, and its launch should therefore be considered, not rushed.
The process is now proceeding at an astonishing - and worrying - pace.
The nomination of the first judges was requested by the end of April with the aim of holding elections at the African Union Summit in Addis Ababa from 5 to 7 July.
Experience elsewhere suggests that once judges are appointed, rules of procedure drawn up and adopted, and relations with other international bodies, the system will be established.
Whatever flaws and shortcomings are built in at the beginning will get caught.
But building a sound international justice system cannot be rushed; it requires time and resources - both human and financial - and a lot of support.
It took more than four years to establish the International Criminal Court physically, and it took massive efforts by the United Nations, several large countries, and hundreds of experts, NGOs, and think tanks to achieve this.
Admittedly, sometimes time is a luxury.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and Rwanda (ICTR) began its work in less than a year to deal with the heinous crimes that were going on.
But the price of this haste is obvious: when the cases began, the statutes, rules of procedure, and evidence of the courts had to be patched up in advance.
The Statute of the ICTY has been amended four times and the rules of procedure and evidence no less than twenty-seven times.
The figures for the ICTR are only slightly better.
That is a poor record for any court that should provide defendants with security and procedural justice.
All this tinkering was possible because there was an extraordinary consensus in the UN Security Council that the processes should not be delayed.
But such a deal is extraordinary.
Courts that are contractually established, such as the African Court of Justice, may find it very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain the majority needed to support change.
Moreover, effective courts must be politically independent.
However, this can only be achieved if the right conditions are in place from the outset.
The procedure for nominating judges at national level is crucial.
Candidates who are appropriate - and who are widely considered appropriate - are the key to the legitimacy of the Court.
In the European human rights system, the nomination process requires civil society and strict control by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
Only through an open, transparent process can the best candidates - those who give the greatest guarantees of independence - be identified.
But that takes time.
Moreover, the first bank of an international court is crucial because it is responsible for the preparation and adoption of other key documents - such as the Rules of Procedure, internal rules and financial regulations - that will determine the court in the coming years.
When they meet in Addis Ababa in July, African leaders would do better to discuss where the court will be located, how it will be funded and, above all, to agree standards for an open, participatory and transparent process for electing its judges.
They should not rush to nominate judges for a court that is still largely on the drawing board.
Africa is about to establish its own human rights court, fifty years after Europe, twenty-five years after America, and two years after the International Criminal Court.
Above all, Africa needs a human rights court that fully and unreservedly respects the governments and peoples of the continent.
Africa's leaders should take a few more months to get it right.
A Human Rights Crimes in Gaza
Atlanta - The world is witnessing a terrible human rights crime in Gaza, where one and a half million people are being held captive without access to the outside world by sea, air or land.
An entire population is brutally punished.
This gross mistreatment of Palestinians in Gaza was dramatically escalated by Israel, with US support, after political candidates representing Hamas won a majority of seats in the Palestinian Authority's parliament in 2006.
The election was unanimously assessed as honest and fair by all international observers.
Israel and the US refused to accept the Palestinians "right to form a unity government with Hamas and Fatah, and now, after internal unrest, Hamas alone controls Gaza.
Forty-one of the 43 victorious Hamas candidates who lived in the West Bank have now been detained by Israel, plus another ten who have taken up positions in the short-lived coalition cabinet.
Regardless of the decision in the internal Palestinian partisan struggle between Fatah and Hamas, we must remember that economic sanctions and restrictions on the supply of water, food, electricity and fuel are causing extreme hardship to the innocent people of Gaza, about a million of whom have fled.
Israeli bombs and rockets regularly hit the enclosed area, causing heavy casualties among militants as well as innocent women and children.
Before last week's high-profile killing of a woman and her four young children, this pattern was illustrated by an earlier report by leading Israeli human rights organization B < unk > Tselem, which said 106 Palestinians were killed between February 27 and March 3.
Fifty-four of them were civilians who did not take part in the fighting, and 25 were under the age of 18.
On a recent trip to the Middle East, I tried to gain a better understanding of the crisis.
One of my visits was to Sderot, a community of some 20,000 inhabitants in southern Israel, which is often hit by rudimentary rockets fired from nearby Gaza.
I condemned these attacks as a heinous and terrorist act, as most of the 13 victims over the last seven years have not been fighters.
I then met with Hamas leaders, both with a delegation from Gaza and with top officials in Damascus, Syria.
I also condemned them and urged them to declare a unilateral ceasefire or to conclude a reciprocal agreement with Israel to end all military action in and around Gaza for an extended period.
They replied that such previous actions had not been reciprocated by them, and they reminded me that Hamas had previously insisted on a ceasefire throughout Palestine, including both Gaza and the West Bank, which Israel had rejected.
Hamas then made a public proposal for a ceasefire limited to Gaza, which the Israelis considered and rejected.
There are passionate arguments on both sides to blame for a lack of peace in the Holy Land.
Israel has occupied and colonized the Palestinian West Bank, about a quarter (28.5%) of the size of the State of Israel recognized by the international community.
Some religious groups in Israel claim a right to land on both sides of the Jordan River, while others claim that their 205 settlements, with around 500,000 people, are necessary for security.
All Arab nations have agreed to the full recognition of Israel if it complies with key United Nations resolutions.
Hamas has agreed to accept any negotiated peace agreement between Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, provided it is approved by the Palestinian people in a referendum.
This promises progress, but despite the brief bluster and positive declarations at last November's peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, it has backtracked.
In Palestine, 9,000 new Israeli settlement units were announced, the number of roadblocks in the West Bank increased, and the stranglehold on Gaza tightened.
One hundred years of superconductivity
CHICAGO - The world's first "quantum computer," a machine that harnesses the magic of quantum phenomena to perform memory and processing tasks incredibly faster than today's silicon-based computer chips, was recently sold to Lockheed-Martin by Canada's D-Wave Systems.
And while some doubt whether the machine is really a quantum computer, its developers have published articles in scientific journals that show that the basic elements of this novel computer are indeed superconducting quantum bits.
This spring marks the 100th anniversary of the discovery of superconductivity - the ability of materials to transport electrical current without loss.
Currents, which are formed in superconducting wires, can exist for years without measurable decay.
Due to this property, superconductors have unique properties that can be used in a variety of ways.
They can transport huge volumes of electricity, making them ideal for urban grids.
And when wound into coils, they can generate extremely strong magnetic fields.
Such superconducting magnets have been used in a variety of technologies.
The best-known examples are the magnets that drive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in most hospitals.
Perhaps most exotic are the giant magnets used to accelerate particles in the Large Hadron Collider, which aims to discover the fundamental principles of matter.
However, despite their promising properties, superconductors have limitations, the primary being that most superconductors operate at very low temperatures or even near absolute zero (-273 ºC).
Such temperatures can only be achieved by liquid-helium cooling.
Swiss researchers caused a stir in 1986 when they announced the discovery of superconductivity in a copper oxide that was twice as hot as the previous record holder.
Shortly thereafter, researchers in the US found a related material that superconducts above the temperature at which air liquefies.
As Time Magazine announced in May 1987, the discovery of these so-called "cuprates" marked the beginning of the superconducting revolution.
Unfortunately, the revolution soon faltered.
Cuprates are notoriously difficult to process because they are very brittle.
To make matters worse, due to their strong anisotropy, the materials have a quasi two-dimensional structure consisting of a weakly coupled stack of conductive sheets.
As such, they represent a challenge for industry, even if initial applications are emerging.
Since the first appearance of the cuprates, a number of other high-temperature superconductors have been discovered, one a simple compound of magnesium and boron, the other a mixture of iron and arsenic.
Although none of them superconducts at temperatures as high as liquid air, they could ultimately be better materials to work with.
Given the enormous number of element combinations that can form compounds, there is a good chance that better superconductors will await our discovery.
In the coming years, superconductors are expected to play a growing role in technology.
Second-generation copper cables are already being used to produce high-performance cables for power transmission and lighter generators for wind turbines.
Stronger superconducting magnets lead to the development of MRI with more complex diagnostic capabilities.
Superconductors are used for floating trains in high-speed traffic and as microwave filters for improved signal bandwidth in cellular base stations.
The discovery of a new superconductor with improved properties could lead to even greater technological innovations.
This brings us to the intellectual challenge of superconductors.
It took 46 years from the discovery of superconductivity to the 1957 Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS) theory of how the phenomenon arose.
Along the way, a number of famous physicists tried and failed to find the answer, citing Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, and Richard Feynman as outstanding examples.
In order to find the solution, advanced theoretical techniques had to be developed.
It was difficult to find out how electrons could be brought to superconductivity.
The fundamental discovery of BCS was that when the electrons mate, these pairs can actually work superconductively.
Fortunately, the mechanism for such a coupling was known.
Although electrons are negatively charged and thus repel each other, the positive ions they leave behind when they flow through a metal can mediate an effective attraction between two electrons under restrictive conditions (for example, the metal must be very cold).
However, the suspicion is that this is not the case with the new superconductors.
Cuprates superconducts at much higher temperatures, but above all they possess some exotic properties: They are formed by doping electrical carriers into a host material that is a magnetic insulator - the last place you would look for a conventional superconductor.
And in contrast to the BCS theory, where the pairs are isotropic and have identical properties in all spatial directions, the pairs in cuprates are strongly anisotropic and resemble a clover leaf.
How can electrons be paired without ions holding them together, thus enabling superconductors with higher temperatures?
Ideas abound, but new theoretical breakthroughs are likely to be needed to develop the machinery needed to solve such electron-electron theories, perhaps even including black holes.
Whatever the theory, it is certain to revolutionize physics.
A Japanese metamorphosis?
OSAKA - Yesterday's landslide victory by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) in parliamentary elections ended the one-party system that the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has controlled almost continuously since 1955.
For most of the last decade, the DPJ was not seen as a viable alternative to the LDP, though it appeared to be a pseudo-two-party system.
Twenty years after the end of the Cold War, Japan will finally have a post-Cold War system of government.
Even now, the Japanese public remains unsure of the DPJ's ability to govern, and is skeptical of its rosy wealth-redistribution programs, which lack sound financing.
The public is also fully aware that the ideologically fragmented DPJ lacks a pragmatic, coherent foreign and security policy.
Nonetheless, public outrage at the LDP means that the DPJ will form the next government.
Over the past four years, the LDP has proved wholly unresponsive to the central issues of public concern: pensions, unemployment, and the fraying social safety net.
Moreover, the LDP has been plagued by a series of minor scandals and consistent botching.
That the LDP needed three different prime ministers in little more than a year made it clear that the party's power core had melted.
Once in power, the DPJ will immediately confront the massive bureaucracy and entrenched mandarins who usually sabotage any efforts at administrative reform that threaten its power and vested interests.
Indeed, the budget estimates for the next fiscal year are due immediately after the election.
The figures presented are the result of a lengthy process in which the bureaucracy has consulted closely with the LDP.
So, without breaking the regular budgetary cycle, the DPJ will be forced not only to implement the supplementary budget drawn up by the LDP, but also to adhere to next year's budget, which embodies the LDP's policies denounced by the DPJ.
As a result, the DPJ has announced plans to repeal the LDP's guidelines for a cap on budget requests in order to rewrite its own budget from scratch.
The supplementary budget will also be revised.
But time is short, and few of the new DPJ members have the legislative experience and fiscal expertise to do so.
To gain control of the mandarins, the DPJ plans to send 100 deputies to the ministries and top leadership, as well as three dozen political appointees to political staff in the prime minister's office.
Unfortunately, the DPJ has abolished an LDP-sponsored public-service reform law that would have allowed the DPJ to replace mandarins with an army of political appointees.
The DPJ, despite its manifesto, seems unwilling to tame the mandarins, and may therefore be forced to rely on them.
The rise of mandarins is a legacy of Japan's unique historical development into early modern times.
Unlike in Europe, Japan developed its state before building a strong civil society.
Indeed, the full-fledged reconstruction of society began only after the Meiji Restoration of 1868, which finally tipped the balance of power in favor of the state.
As a result, the mandarins survived World War II and the post-war American occupation relatively unscathed, and they will seek to survive the DPJ government as well.
They will most likely succeed.
LDP deputies and mandarins developed a routine in which mandarins drafted Cabinet-sponsored bills, LDP deputies examined the bills, and the two together finalized bills before they were introduced to the state legislature (parliament).
Since the LDP, most recently with a coalition partner, controlled the state parliament, the legislative process consisted only of interaction between LDP deputies and elected officials based at LDP headquarters.
The role of the Parliament was merely pro forma.
Indeed, under the LDP-led one-party system, this extra-constitutional mechanism became an integral part of Japanese government policy.
The DPJ government will clash head-on with bureaucrats, in part because the party will find it difficult to recruit sufficiently skilled politicians.
The mandarins have maintained their privileged position in this regard, in part because of the tax system, which prevents the emergence of non-profit institutions, particularly think tanks, where independent political expertise can be forged.
Moreover, the mandarins, perhaps in anticipation of a change of power, have driven annual personnel changes in the major ministries and top administrative posts.
And what about the LDP?
Once overthrown, it will lose control over the redistribution of state resources.
Unable to repay its electorate, the LDP risks disintegration, because it has never been a party with deep grassroots support, but operates as a power and redistribution machine through a network of insiders in the country's industrial sectors, professional associations, and local communities.
Only by recruiting new blood and reorganizing with a solid ideological platform will the LDP be able to make a comeback.
The DPJ has even weaker grassroots support, so mandarins will most likely use their usual divide-and-rule techniques to persuade the party by teaching it to imitate the LDP by using government money and contracts to support its key constituencies, such as labor unions and other interest groups.
The birth of the DPJ government may yet be a turning point.
There has been a huge shift of power in favour of society.
A jobless recovery?
CAMBRIDGE - Who will suffer the longest and most from the implosion of Wall Street in 2008-2009 and the subsequent global recession?
Not the bankers and financiers who caused the disaster.
Some financiers, such as Bernard Madoff, face jail for fraud.
But, while Madoff was only the tip of the iceberg of rampant financial misconduct, most suspected financiers do not have to fear arrest, either because their behavior is simply beyond the law, or because financial irregularities, more subtle than outright fraud, are often difficult to prove.
Some bank bosses will walk away embarrassed, but with huge payments to ease their pain - such as the $55 million golden parachute handed to Ken Lewis of Bank of America with his and Fred Godwin of Royal Bank of Scotland with his £25 million pension.
But, buoyed by government bailouts, guarantees, and low interest rates, many banks have begun paying huge bonuses to their top executives again, while vigorously fighting reforms aimed at curbing risk-taking and remuneration.
The big losers from this economic catastrophe are workers in the advanced countries, who have bought the laissez-faire flexibility of American-style capitalism.
Between 2007 and October 2009, the United States lost nearly eight million jobs, reducing the employment rate from 63% to 58.5%.
Unemployment stood at more than 10% at the end of 2009, unemployment was the longest since the Great Depression, millions of people had their hours cut, and millions more were too discouraged by a lack of jobs to look for work.
The industrialised countries of Europe, Canada and Japan have also suffered significant job losses, which will continue for a long time to come.
Spain, which allows widespread temporary contracts, has seen the biggest rise in unemployment because Spanish workers can be laid off just as quickly as those in the US.
Some countries - such as Germany, Sweden, and South Korea - have concealed their unemployment by paying firms to keep workers on the payroll.
This may work in the short term, but it cannot be sustained in the long term.
From the 1980 "s to mid-2000, employment lagged behind GDP in economic recovery.
In the US, there was a jobless recovery under President Bill Clinton until the dot.com boom in the second half of the 1990 "s, and a jobless recovery under George W. Bush in the wake of the 2001 economic downturn.
In the early 1990 "s, Sweden suffered a huge recession triggered by a real estate bubble and a banking crisis.
The unemployment rate rose from 1.8% in 1990 to 9.6% in 1994, before bottoming out at 5% in 2001.
Sixteen years after the crisis, the unemployment rate stood at 6.2%, more than three times higher than in 1990.
In 1997, Korea suffered not only from the Asian financial crisis, but also from pressure from the US and the International Monetary Fund to raise interest rates and implement Washington Consensus-style reforms to get help.
Employment recovered, but mainly in "non-regular" jobs with limited benefits, low wages, and low job security.
Inequality in Korea rose from moderate levels to the second-highest level (behind the US) among OECD industrialized countries.
Weakness in the labour market is taking a huge toll on economic and personal wellbeing.
Young people looking for their first job and experienced workers who lose their jobs in a weak labour market suffer economic losses that will last a lifetime.
Happiness studies show that unemployment reduces happiness just as much as the loss of a family member.
It is hard to imagine the US returning to full employment any time soon.
Between 1993 and 1998, the US created millions of jobs, increasing the employment rate by 5.4 percentage points.
If employment were to rise at this rate in 2010, it would take until 2015 to reach its pre-recession level.
And the slow recovery in the US will slow the recovery in other advanced economies and also reduce their employment.
A long, painful period of high unemployment runs counter to what most experts believe the flexible US economic model will ever produce.
Since the early 1990 "s, many analysts have viewed America's weak unionization, arbitrary employment, limited legal protections against dismissal, and high job turnover as important factors in achieving a lower unemployment rate than most EU countries.
Many OECD countries have undertaken various types of flexibility reforms in the hope of improving their economies along the lines of the US.
The view that flexibility is the key factor in employment is no longer tenable.
In its 2009 Employment Outlook, the OECD looked closely at its favoured policy reforms and found that they do not help countries prepare for a financial recession.
According to the OECD, there seems to be no strong reason to believe that recent structural reforms have made OECD labor markets much less sensitive to severe economic downturns.
So the lesson of the recession is clear.
The weak pipe in capitalism is not the labour market, but the financial market.
At worst, labor-market failures impose modest inefficiency costs on society, while capital-market failures inflict great harm on society, with workers, not the perpetrators of the financial catastrophe, suffering the most.
Moreover, globalization is causing the failure of the US capital market to spread misery around the world.
We owe it to the workers who are suffering from this recession to reinvent finance so that it works to enrich the real economy rather than just to enrich the financiers.
This means changing the incentives and rules for the financial sector.
With other countries, economies, and jobs at stake, they owe it to their citizens to push the US for meaningful financial reform.
France's Midsummer Night's Dream
PARIS - Bastille Day, France's national holiday, was glorious this year.
The military parade, dominated by the victory celebration in Mali and the joint participation of African and UN troops, had the perfection of a graceful, if muscular, ballet.
The classical concert that preceded the big fireworks display that ended the day was the closest to a French version of the Proms in London, mixing light classical and popular songs.
The Eiffel Tower filled the evening with its magic.
Paris, it seemed for one night at least, remains the capital of the world.
The melancholy that gripped France many years ago was all but forgotten.
The celebration of the glory of the past, mixed with popular English songs of the present, seemed to be a sign of renewed national confidence.
What was the meaning of this moment of grace?
Was it the product of a collective deception, a kind of emotional Potemkin village, encouraged, if not devised, by the authorities to restore some self-confidence to France's depressed citizens?
Even if the positive emotions remain fleeting (which seems most likely), they were real and tangible.
The French seemed to be in a celebratory mood.
Of course, it could have just been the weather; after a miserable spring, a glorious summer has finally arrived.
But it may also have been one of those natural turning points to say a collective and spontaneous decision: "End the depression, let's move on."
We have a great revolutionary past that still conveys universal values such as freedom, equality, fraternity and an army that, as in Mali, continues to make a difference in the world.
There are two lessons to be drawn from this collective form of escapism.
The first is that beyond the many layers of depression and mistrust in France, there is potential for a new and collective awakening.
This would, of course, require less cynical political elites, who can overcome their petty ambitions and divisions for the good of the country.
The second, more obvious lesson is that reality cannot be changed by a simple public spectacle.
France is not imperial Rome, where panem et circenses made a fundamental difference.
It is a weakened democracy, mired in an economic and social crisis so deep that it borders on an identity crisis.
The proof was a third traditional event on Bastille Day, between the military parade in the morning and the music and fireworks in the evening: President François Hollande's speech to the nation, which took the form of an interview with two prominent journalists.
He was in a comforting mood, too.
According to Hollande, the economic recovery had only just begun and hope was just around the corner.
His tone and message had changed.
He was no longer the "normal man" of his previous campaign and term in office; instead, he sought to present himself as a superhero, like his predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy.
Of course, given his personality and low public approval ratings, his speech was the least convincing of the day.
Who could have said with certainty that the economic recovery announced by Hollande was real and undesirable?
Beyond his wishful thinking, the public reaction to the messenger was a mixture of incredulity and indifference.
When I saw the behaviour of friends, all French, who were listening to Hollande with me, I was reminded of another moment.
It was 31 December 1989, and I was in the Soviet Union listening to President Mikhail Gorbachev's New Year wishes in a restaurant in the old town of Suzdal.
I was moved: the man who symbolised glasnost and perestroika, who had enabled the peaceful emancipation of much of Eastern and Central Europe, spoke.
But I was the only one paying him attention.
The restaurateurs, like my French friends now, couldn't care less.
Their president had become a background noise.
Has Hollande become a French Gorbachev in this sense?
For the Left and the Greens, he is on the verge of being a traitor.
These voters elected him a year ago not only because he was not Sarkozy, but because he embodied the values of the true left, even if his centrist credentials seemed a bad omen.
Voters from the center, or even the center-right, are also disappointed by their president's lack of charisma, if not sheer incompetence.
After a year of Hollande, France is undergoing a fundamental political revolution.
During the half-century of the Fifth Republic, a bipartisan system of left and right has traditionally prevailed.
But now France is becoming a country dominated by a more or less equally strong tripartite system: the left, the right, and the extreme right.
If France is to capitalize on the positive emotions of Bastille Day, it will need much more responsible elites willing to unite in the fight against unemployment and its causes (lack of competitiveness and rigid labor markets) and consequences (rise of populist, not republican, forces).
What Bastille Day has shown, albeit briefly and superficially, is that there is the potential to unify France.
Kick-off for peace?
Yerevan - Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan's recent invitation to Turkish President Abdullah Gul to visit Yerevan to watch a football game together was historic.
Given the two countries "long-strained relations, this visit would have been remarkable at any time.
But, just a month after the alarming Russian-Georgian confrontation, there may be real hope that tensions in the volatile Caucasus region can be eased.
Of course, old and difficult issues divide Armenia and Turkey.
But now is the time for both countries to put the past aside to address their common security concerns.
In the new context created by the war in Georgia, the urgency of Turkey becoming a real bridge between the nations of the Caucasus is not lost on anyone.
This expectation is an inevitable consequence of Turkey's geography and history.
Located figuratively between modernity and tradition, secularism and Islam, and democracy and tyranny, Turkey is also a real physical bridge between East and West.
For the peoples of the Caucasus, Turkey marks our road to Europe.
It is a NATO member and borders the three Caucasus republics, which have individual NATO Partnership Action Programmes.
It aspires to join the European Union and would bring the EU to our three borders, just as we aspire to join one day.
Indeed, Turkey has never missed an opportunity to present itself as a regional broker.
Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Turkey proposed Black Sea cooperation.
This year, as US-led efforts to broker a Middle East peace settlement began to falter, Turkey took on the role of mediator in both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Syria-Israel conflict.
Now, in the immediate aftermath of the Russian-Georgian crisis, the Turkish leadership has once again taken on a leading role in the Caucasus.
The world must fervently hope that Turkey's proposal for a Caucasus Platform for Stability and Cooperation is more serious and sustained than previous similar efforts.
But, in order to succeed, Turkey must stick firmly to the promise of all actors in the region to refrain from using force to resolve their disputes.
If this promise is accepted and respected, conflicts in the region will be viewed in a very different, more tolerant context, marking a historic breakthrough to peace.
Why not take the idea of such a pact a step further?
We in this region can and should demand a non-aligned Caucasus, free from security blocs and hostile alliances.
After all, security alliances and guarantees only create dividing lines, with their associated security challenges.
Throughout history, our countries and peoples have lived under one roof for much longer than we were divided.
Today, we share a common vision of European integration, and it is in this broader context that our conflicts should be resolved.
The visits of French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Georgia and Russia have proved that there is no substitute for Europe when it comes to the Caucasus.
Only Europe can play the role of honest broker in the atmosphere of mistrust and intolerance in the region.
But at the end of the day, we ourselves must be prepared to work towards an area of peace and cooperation.
The Caucasus is too small a space for closed borders and explosive conflicts.
Although some of these tensions appear purely bilateral, the Georgian-Russian conflict shows that such a thing no longer exists in this globalized world, let alone in this interconnected region.
Indeed, genuine peace in the Caucasus requires two crucial strategic changes.
One lesson from history is that Russia's strategic interests cannot be ignored here.
To believe otherwise and behave differently would lead to regional chaos.
The other lesson is that Turkey and Armenia cannot remain enemies forever.
There must be normalization in our relations so that the Caucasus can merge into a functioning region.
Ironically, both Russia and the United States recognize that this is in their interest.
The Russians see normal relations between Turkey and Armenia as a way to minimize Georgia's strategic role in the region.
The US sees an opening to Turkey as a way to reduce Armenia's real and perceived dependence on Russia.
Beyond the emotional impact of President Gul's visit to Yerevan, a real improvement in Turkish-Armenian relations will require the opening of the two closed borders - the last in Europe.
Or, firstly, the existing rail link between the two countries could be put into operation.
If this does not happen within the next few weeks and months, then Turkey will have shown that all this was just a show.
President Gul's visit marks a turning point - either as a failure to make history or as the beginning of a new era.
Permanent poison
NEW YORK - Next year will mark the twentieth anniversary of the collapse of communism in Europe.
Liberated from the complexities of knowing too much about the cruel past, the young people of Eastern Europe's post-communist generation do not seem interested in what their parents and grandparents went through.
But the recent revelation of Czech writer Milan Kundera's alleged complicity in Stalinism is only the latest in a long half-life of a toxic past.
Other examples spring to mind: the accusations of cooperation with the secret police levelled at Lech Walesa, Romania's public controversies over Mircea Eliade's fascist past, and the attacks on the alleged "Jewish monopoly of suffering," which equate the Holocaust with the Soviet gulag.
Friedrich Nietzsche said that anyone who looks the devil in the eye for too long runs the risk of becoming the devil himself.
A Bolshevik anti-communism, similar in its dogmatism to communism itself, has caused uproar from time to time in parts of Eastern Europe.
In country after country, this Manichean way of thinking, with its simplifications and manipulations, has merely been reshaped to serve the new rulers.
Of course, opportunism also has its part to play in this.
In 1945, when the Red Army occupied Romania, the Communist Party had no more than 1,000 members; in 1989 it had almost four million.
A day after Nicolae Ceausescu was executed, most of these people suddenly became bitter anti-communists and victims of the system they had served for decades.
Remnants of totalitarian thinking can also be found in hostility to former dissidents such as Adam Michnik and Václav Havel, who both argued that the new democracies should not exploit resentment or seek revenge, as the totalitarian state did, but should instead build a new national consensus to structure and strengthen a genuine civil society.
Former generals of the secret police and members of the Communist nomenklatura, untouchable in their comfortable villas and pensions, must take great pleasure in watching today's witch hunts and the manipulation of old files for immediate political purposes.
But the Kundera case seems different, if no less troubling.
In 1950, Kundera, then a 20-year-old communist, allegedly denounced a man he had never met as a Western spy.
The man was later brutally interrogated in a former Gestapo torture centre and spent 14 years in prison.
Kundera's name was included in the investigator's report, which was authenticated after a respected historian discovered it in a dusty Prague archive.
The reclusive Kundera, who immigrated to Paris in 1975, declared that "it never happened." Moreover, the fearsome Czechoslovak secret police, which had every interest in silencing or compromising the famous dissident writer, never used the incident to blackmail or expose him.
Until further information is available from both Kundera and the authorities, the case will not be beyond reasonable doubt.
But when it did, the case requires deeper reflection.
As far as we know, Kundera was never an informant before or after this incident, and we cannot ignore the fact that he later freed himself from the obligatory totalitarian happiness propagated by communism.
Indeed, his case also serves as a reminder that the early 1950 "s were the most brutal period of" proletarian dictatorship "in Eastern Europe - a period of great enthusiasm and dreadful fear that poisoned the minds and souls of faithful believers, bitter opponents, and apathetic spectators alike.
Moreover, Kundera's case is not unique.
In 2006, German Nobel laureate Günter Grass revealed that he had joined the Waffen-SS as a teenager 60 years earlier.
Similarly, a few years ago, the world was shocked to learn that the famous Italian writer Ignazio Silone had collaborated with the fascist police in his youth.
Everyday life under totalitarianism, whether communist or fascist, has routinely been based on a deep duplicity, the effects of which are long-lasting.
I do not agree with those who say that we should not be interested in the dark episodes in the life of a great writer.
Why not?
We should not be interested in criminal justice, but in gaining a deeper understanding of a bloody, demagogic and tyrannical utopia, human weakness and vulnerability.
It can even be seen as a worthwhile testimony to an artist's ability to overcome his past mistakes and still create priceless works.
But can we justify morally compromised artists and intellectuals on the basis of their work or merit, while condemning ordinary people for crimes that are often less serious?
An egregious example of this was the way in which supporters of the Romanian philosopher Constantin Noica defended his support for the fascist Iron Guard and his subsequent collaboration with the Communists, even condemning a cleaner for wiping the floor in the offices of the secret police.
Shouldn't the efforts of the cleaner to feed her family, her children and her own survival be equally taken into account?
Life under totalitarianism was an extreme situation that requires us to apply special, differentiated rules to all prisoners of this ordeal.
To understand this epoch, we often need to know and carefully assess ambiguous and overwhelming circumstances, and never simplify a complex daily reality in favor of current political goals.
In order to forgive, we must at least know what we forgive.
In Eastern Europe today, young and old alike benefit from this lesson.
A League of Democracies?
LONDON - Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, has called for the creation of a "League of Democrats."
This new international group would have a formidable military capacity, based partly on NATO and partly on a "new quadrilateral security partnership" in the Pacific between Australia, India, Japan, and the US.
Of course, neither Russia nor China would be invited to join: indeed, McCain wants to exclude Russia from the G8.
The League is necessary, McCain said, because the US and its democratic partners must be able to act without the permission of the United Nations (i.e. Russia and China) on issues of critical importance to the US, such as the fight against Islamic terrorism, humanitarian intervention, and the spread of freedom, democracy, and free markets.
In other words, the League's main goal is to marginalize Russia and China in world politics.
The most damning criticism of McCain's plan is that it would unleash a new Cold War between what are called democracies and autocracies.
This is not only dangerous, but also incoherent.
Russia and China do not threaten the "free world" with a powerful ideology and massive armed forces, as they did during the Cold War.
Moreover, the world's democracies themselves are at odds over how to deal with Islamic terrorism or genocide in Darfur: after all, it was France that led the opposition in the UN Security Council to the US invasion of Iraq.
Moreover, the US needs Russian and Chinese help on issues such as terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and climate change.
Stigmatizing Russia and China as pariahs will not bring them on board.
(China must learn to behave responsibly, "McCain declares with breathtaking condescension.)
Indeed, Russia has mostly cooperated with the US in the "war on terrorism."
Finally, the idea is impractical.
One cannot imagine India or Brazil wanting to be part of such a combination.
So we would all save ourselves a lot of trouble if McCain's brainwave were buried as quickly as possible.
But at the heart of this idea is a serious proposal, as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair often eloquently put it: democracies do not fight each other, so wars would cease if the whole world were democratic.
Presumably, McCain's League of Democracies is designed to bring Immanuel Kant's dream of eternal peace closer to realization by pressuring non-democracies to change their ways, by force if necessary, not to mention the bloody failure of efforts to make democracy flourish in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Is it true that democracies never fight each other?
The answer in the affirmative seems to depend on two different claims.
The first is that democracies have never historically fought each other.
This is true of a rather small group of rich countries (India is a partial exception), especially in Western Europe and its overseas offshoots, since World War II.
Furthermore, these are "our kind of democracy," constitutional democracies that contain all the features that we take for granted in modern Western systems, and not "Islamic democracies" such as Iran.
A reasonable generalization of this rather small example would be that prosperous democracies, governed by the rule of law, tend to live together in peace.
The second assertion is that these countries live in peace because they are democracies.
But is it democracy that has brought them peace and prosperity, or is it peace and prosperity that has brought democracy?
Is it democracy that has kept Europe peaceful since 1945, or is it the long period of peace since 1945 that has enabled democracy to become the European norm?
The world already has a peacekeeping institution.
The UN was created according to rules designed to enable states of different political stripes to live together.
Members accept the obligation not to use force except in self-defense or if it is not authorized by the Security Council.
The US is frustrated that it cannot get its way at the UN.
But the UN exists to protect all states from lawless behavior, including the US.
By implicitly bypassing the UN and dividing the world into two armed camps, the League of Democracies would increase the risk of war.
Moreover, the world already has a wealth-distribution mechanism.
It's called trade.
The World Trade Organisation was set up in 1994 to liberalise trade in accordance with agreed rules, and it is full of errors that need to be corrected.
But we don't need a league of democracies to do that.
By subjecting trade relations to embargoes, sanctions, and tests of democracy, environmental standards, and human rights, the League is likely to slow down the growth of trade, and thus the opportunity for poor non-democracies to catch up.
The only purpose of the League of Democracies seems to be to legitimise warfare by democracies in order to spread democracy!
That's the thrust of McCain's message.
As he put it, the US was built to serve "eternal and universal principles."
Their God-given task is to build lasting global peace on the foundations of freedom, security, prosperity and hope.
Noble rhetoric!
But if that's the purpose of the league, and I don't see any other purpose, then that's a danger to peace.
This is because its proponents believe that long-term coexistence with non-democracies is impossible.
This is crazy and unhistorical.
It is up to the chastened nations of Western Europe, which broadly share American values but have learned something about political patience, to put a stop to the American fantasy of shaping the world in their own image.
I am in favour of spreading Western-style democracy, but not at the cost of making the world more belligerent.
A less-is-more growth strategy for Africa
REYKJAVIK: If African countries were to pursue policies designed only to stimulate economic growth and improve macroeconomic stability, they should reduce the number of currencies in circulation on the continent as quickly as possible.
This would most likely boost trade, as happened in Europe with the introduction of the euro, and could help contain inflation - which is always good for growth - by imposing international discipline on monetary policy.
The African Union now aims to bundle all the continent's currencies into a single currency by 2028.
In the meantime, alongside the two existing monetary unions, one is de jure and one is de facto on the drawing board.
The most important and oldest of these unions consists of the fourteen countries belonging to the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa and the West African Economic and Monetary Union, both of which use the CFA franc.
The second of these unions consists of Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland and now Zimbabwe, all of which use the South African Rand.
Apart from Zimbabwe, a recent and incomplete convert, the 18 countries of the two existing monetary unions have, as intended, benefited from lower inflation than much of the rest of Africa.
To see why, think of Nigeria.
Before independence, Nigeria's legal tender was the British pound.
With the establishment of the Central Bank of Nigeria in 1959, the Nigerian pound was introduced.
Back then, one Nigerian pound was the equivalent of one British pound.
This arrangement remained intact until 1973, when Nigeria introduced a new currency, the naira.
The exchange rate remained unchanged: one naira was the equivalent of one British pound.
The naira was intended to strengthen the country's independence by allowing the central bank to pursue its own monetary policy.
It was also a matter of national pride.
The idea behind the new arrangement was that an independent and flexible monetary policy would serve the nation's interests better than a fixed exchange rate that pegs the naira to the pound.
But the introduction of the naira quickly ended parity with the British pound.
Despite soaring foreign exchange revenues from oil exports after 1970, government spending exceeded federal revenue.
The federal government's budget deficits were financed by foreign and domestic borrowing and money printing, leading to inflation and devaluation of the new currency.
Today, buying a British pound costs 220 naira, an average annual depreciation of 15% since 1973.
This devaluation might be justified if Nigeria had managed to use cheap money to narrow the gap between the standard of living of ordinary Nigerians and that of people living in Britain.
But it didn't happen.
The purchasing power of national income per person in Nigeria is now 50% lower than in the United Kingdom in 1980.
Given this experience, Nigeria now plans to abolish the naira in favor of joining a monetary union with four or five other West African countries (Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and perhaps Liberia).
But this planned monetary union, which until recently was planned for 2009, is now on hold.
Why so?
The smallest countries show no signs of fear of being swamped by Nigeria, by far the most populous country in the group (155 million of the six countries with 200 million inhabitants), especially as the new West African Central Bank is to be located in Accra, Ghana's capital (24 million).
Others fear that their sovereignty will be diminished if the new Central Bank of the West African Monetary Area assumes some of the policymaking responsibilities of national central banks.
But that, of course, is the main purpose of monetary union.
When the West African currency zone is finally established, the number of currencies in Africa will be about half the number of countries.
And if the five-member East African Community (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda) reemerges as planned, the number of currencies will be reduced by another four.
The belief that sovereign national currencies, by allowing an independent and flexible monetary policy, are the best way to promote economic and social development, as Nigeria's post-colonial leaders see it, is gradually falling by the wayside.
Efficiency requires the use of fewer and larger currencies (and foreign investors, understandably wary of weak and volatile currencies, demand this).
Indeed, the success of the European Union and the euro since its introduction in Africa in 1999 has made a strong impression.
Currencies are, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, like democracies: the best way to preserve their integrity is to share them.
A Liquid Europe
BRUSSELS - Is the eurozone coming back from the brink?
This could only be possible because the emerging outlines of a new framework for resolving the ongoing sovereign-debt crisis contain a key component that has been missing.
Indeed, this absence was the reason for this summer's deepening financial crisis, which went beyond small peripheral countries like Greece, Ireland, and Portugal to hit systemically important countries like Italy and Spain.
The contagion started with investors "realization that Europe's rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, was intended only for peripheral countries.
It simply does not have, and never will have, enough money to carry out the massive bond purchases needed to stabilize the debt markets of large economies like Spain and Italy.
The EFSF has a maximum of €440 billion at its disposal (any increase would jeopardize France's triple-A rating), while the combined national debt of Italy and Spain is more than €2 trillion.
In early August, the domino effect of the sovereign-debt crisis began in the eurozone periphery, because financial markets are not waiting for one country after another to downgrade.
Instead, they tend to anticipate the endgame, or at least one possible scenario, namely the dissolution of the entire crisis containment structure.
Markets noticed that the euro seemed trapped between a rock (the EFSF's limited lending capacity) and a hard place (the European Central Bank's great reluctance to buy government bonds in financial distress on a large scale).
It later emerged that the ECB was not that heavy, though it emphasized that it would no longer intervene once the new EFSF was operational.
And, given the EFSF's limited firepower, the market would have been left without support.
More broadly, the eurozone needs a liquidity guarantee for its budgetary authority.
In a "normal" economy with its own currency, the treasury can never face a liquidity squeeze, because the government can always rely, at least potentially, on central bank support.
A eurozone government, by contrast, is always in a precarious position: it has only very long-term assets (its tax power) and short-term liabilities, namely sovereign debt, much of which must be repurchased annually.
If investors refuse to buy the debt on any terms, even a fiscally prudent government could run into a liquidity crunch and default.
Similarly, banks have short-term liabilities (deposits) and long-term assets that they cannot liquidate quickly without large losses.
That is why all countries provide emergency liquidity support when a bank run occurs, as happened worldwide when confidence in the banking sector collapsed with Lehman Brothers in 2008.
Likewise, the eurozone needs a mechanism to deal with the run on its member countries "sovereign debt.
This requires that financial authorities have access to a large pool of liquidity in an emergency.
This insurance can only be provided by the ECB.
The good news is that a solution is slowly taking shape that promises to create a mechanism through which the ECB could support the EFSF.
This could be achieved simply by registering the EFSF as a bank, giving it access to normal ECB refinancing on the same terms as other normal banks.
The EFSF could then make very large purchases of government bonds by increasing its limited capital through ECB refinancing and using the government bonds it purchases as collateral.
In this way, an appropriate division of labour could be established.
The EFSF would be responsible for managing fiscal crises in member states.
For countries with solvency problems, an adjustment programme such as for Greece, Ireland or Portugal would be appropriate.
But for large countries facing liquidity shortages, the EFSF could rely on ECB support.
When investors know that a liquidity crunch is no longer possible, they will refrain from speculative attacks on solvent countries.
The near-panic in the financial markets eased as soon as rumors began to circulate that this solution had been discussed, at least behind closed doors.
It needs to be implemented now.
As always in Europe, there are legal and political obstacles to change.
But even the most reluctant policymakers recognize that the cost of inaction is too high.
Legal obstacles to possible "monetary financing" of the public sector in the EU Treaties can be overcome.
The more important obstacle is Germany's reluctance to publicly acknowledge that ECB liquidity support for sovereign-bond markets can be critical to maintaining financial stability.
Only the German government and the ECB can open the door to this subtle but profound reform of the fundamental foundations of the euro.
It's a decision they can't put off for long.
A credit and a prayer
NEW YORK - Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain, known as the PIIGS, are burdened with increasingly unsustainable public and private debt.
In several of the worst-hit countries - Portugal, Ireland and Greece - borrowing costs have risen to record highs in recent weeks, even after their loss of market access led to bailouts financed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
Spanish borrowing costs are also rising.
Greece is clearly insolvent.
Even with a draconian austerity package totaling 10% of GDP, public debt would rise to 160% of GDP.
Portugal, where growth has been stagnant for a decade, is experiencing a slow-motion fiscal train wreck that will lead to the insolvency of the public sector.
In Ireland and Spain, the transfer of the banking system's huge losses to the state's balance sheet, in addition to already escalating sovereign debt, will eventually lead to sovereign insolvency.
The official approach, Plan A, is to pretend that these economies are suffering from a liquidity crunch, not a solvency problem, and that the provision of rescue loans - together with austerity and structural reforms - can restore debt sustainability and market access.
This "prolong and pretend" or "lend and pray" approach is bound to fail, because most of the options that indebted countries have used in the past to free themselves from excessive debt are unfortunately not feasible.
For example, the PIIGS do not have the time-honored solution of printing money and escaping debt through inflation, because they are trapped in the eurozone straitjacket.
The only institution that can boost the printing press - the European Central Bank - will never resort to the monetization of budget deficits.
Nor can we expect rapid GDP growth to save these countries.
The PIIGS "debt burden is so high that robust economic performance is all but impossible.
Moreover, any economic growth that some of these countries will eventually experience will depend on implementing politically unpopular reforms that will work only in the long run - at the expense of even more short-term pain.
To restore growth, these countries must also regain competitiveness by achieving a real depreciation of their currency, thereby turning trade deficits into surpluses.
But a rising euro, boosted by the ECB's excessively early monetary tightening, implies further real appreciation, further undermining competitiveness.
Germany's solution to this problem, to keep wage growth below productivity growth, thereby reducing unit labor costs, has taken more than a decade to produce results.
If the PIIGS started this process today, the benefits would be too long in coming to restore competitiveness and growth.
The last resort to deflation of wages and prices in order to reduce costs, achieve real depreciation, and restore competitiveness is an ever-deepening recession.
The real depreciation necessary to restore external equilibrium would drive up the real value of euro debt even further, making it even more unsustainable.
Reducing private and public consumption in order to boost private saving and austerity in order to reduce private and public debt are also not options.
The private sector can spend less and save more, but this would entail immediate costs known as the Keynes paradox of austerity: declining economic output and rising debt-to-GDP ratios.
Recent studies by the IMF and others suggest that raising taxes, cutting subsidies, and reducing government spending - even inefficient spending - would stifle growth in the short term and exacerbate the underlying debt problem.
If the PIIGS cannot inflate, grow, devalue, or extricate themselves from their problems, Plan A either fails or is doomed.
The only alternative is to move quickly to Plan B - an orderly restructuring and reduction of the debts of these countries, governments, households, and banks.
This can happen in many ways.
One can carry out an orderly rescheduling of the PIIGS "sovereign debt without actually reducing the amount owed.
This means extending the maturity dates of the debt and lowering the interest rate on the new debt to levels much lower than currently unsustainable market interest rates.
This solution limits the risk of contagion and the potential losses that financial institutions would bear if the value of the debt capital were reduced.
Policymakers should also consider innovations used in the 1980 "s and 1990" s to support debt-burdened developing countries.
For example, bondholders could be encouraged to swap existing bonds for GDP-linked bonds that offer dividends tied to future economic growth.
These instruments effectively make creditors shareholders in a country's economy, entitling them to a share of its future profits, while temporarily reducing its debt burden.
Another way to partially convert mortgage debt into equity is to reduce the face value of mortgages and give creditor banks a premium if home prices rise in the long term.
Bank bonds could also be reduced and converted into equity, which would both prevent a state takeover of banks and prevent socialization of bank losses from triggering a sovereign-debt crisis.
Europe cannot afford to keep throwing money at the problem and praying that growth and time will bring redemption.
No one will fall from the sky, deus ex machina, to save the IMF or the EU.
Long March with China
BEIJING - US Vice President Joe Biden's recent four-day visit to China ended with a bang.
He assured China's leaders that, despite the recent credit downgrade, the United States was determined to pay all its debts; he spoke enthusiastically of the interdependence between the US and China; and he portrayed his granddaughter, who has been studying Chinese for several years, as a future bridge between the two countries.
But behind all the smiles and banquet rush hours, serious issues and perceptual differences continue to divide the world's two great powers.
First of all, there is always an attitude problem.
For those who view China's rise negatively, the country is simply becoming more and more arrogant.
It is tough on its territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea, assertive with its neighbors in the South China Sea, including over disputed islands, showcasing its own stealth fighter during the US Secretary of Defense's visit to China, and sending its first aircraft carrier to sea for testing, hinting at the possibility of establishing naval bases in the Indian Ocean.
Even a brawl between the Chinese and an American basketball team is seen as evidence of China's aggressive behavior.
On the other hand, many Chinese tend to think that the US suffers from a severe case of imaginary superpower syndrome.
As these Chinese see it, the US has a fairly dysfunctional government, but still insists that its political and economic system is the best in the world, and that everyone should emulate it.
The country is heavily indebted, but it cannot stop spending and borrowing.
It is no longer competitive in manufacturing, but blames others for its huge trade deficit.
And the world's only military superpower is often seen within China as trigger happy to interfere in other countries "internal affairs.
Then there is the question of trust.
China's critics argue that its claims to a peaceful rise are not credible, given the country's undemocratic one-party system.
Linked to this is a zero-sum view of the world, in which any Chinese gain in the share of the global economy, or any increased presence in many parts of the world, must come at the expense of the US or other powers.
Any Chinese military action is portrayed as an expansive and aggressive act that must be contained.
Any attempt by Western leaders to interfere, such as Biden's recent trip, is automatically met with doubt and criticism for cuddling dictators.
Likewise, there is always a conspiracy at play for the Chinese, who are suspicious of US intentions.
They see a declining superpower using economic, military, and diplomatic means to prevent China's rise.
Talk of human rights and democracy is nothing more than a smokescreen to demonise China.
Arms sales to Taiwan, Tibetan activism, and color revolutions of various kinds are all sponsored by the US and other Western powers, aimed at weakening China.
Despite decades of close interaction - millions of Americans, Europeans, and Japanese visit China every year, and a similar number of Chinese now visit the US and other developed countries - both sides see themselves through a dark glass.
Increasing interdependence has not even led to better understanding of some of the most fundamental issues.
In a recent interview, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying expressed her country's concern about this state of affairs. "The most important question is whether China and the US are enemies.
Will we be at war?
Are we preparing for war against each other? < unk > Biden reiterated that the U.S. does not regard China as an enemy, but hinted that Fu < unk >'s concerns are not a fantasy, saying the worst-case scenario is a misunderstanding that leads to an unintended conflict.
The key question for China, its neighbors, the US, and the rest of the world, therefore, is not how many aircraft carriers, missiles, submarines, and next-generation warplanes China can produce and deploy in the coming years and decades.
Rather, it is about how China intends to use its newly acquired economic and military strength to pursue its domestic and foreign policy objectives, and how the world's leading powers can ensure that they do not harm each other by accident or misunderstanding.
To meet these challenges successfully, there is no viable alternative to positive, continuous, and open engagement between China and the rest of the world.
The Chinese economy will continue to grow, the Chinese military will continue to modernize, and the Chinese people will remain united in their great power aspirations.
A Cold War-style Western policy of confrontation and containment will face strong opposition from the Chinese, whose global influence, especially in finance, cannot be ignored.
Only a patient, creative, and consistent strategy of engagement will alleviate fears on both sides.
China's rise is a fact; its continued peacefulness must be a priority for China, its neighbors, the West, and, above all, the US.
A looming crisis of antidepressants
The widespread prescription of drugs for mentally disturbed people always ended badly, right down to the days of opioids and cocaine, bromides, barbiturates, and tranquilizers: all turned out to be highly addictive drugs, but it was only after years of denial that doctors admitted that this was so.
Now antidepressants - global brands with household names - are the problem.
Over the past decade, the number of prescriptions has tripled.
Prescriptions of antidepressants in England are now at their highest level since Valium in 1979.
It is now clear that today's antidepressants are not the miracle drugs they were touted as.
The sometimes unbearable withdrawal symptoms, which can make it difficult and dangerous to stop taking antidepressants, also expose many users to severe and depressing side effects: considerable weight gain, loss of libido and mood swings, to name but a few of the most common symptoms.
Suspicions of such problems - particularly drug-induced suicide and depression awareness - have been around for years, but scientific research has only just begun.
A major investigation launched by the UK pharmaceutical authorities in mid-2003 will shortly present its findings.
They will no doubt be presented mainly as recommendations for changes in the small print of the warnings on the labels of medicinal products and in the instructions for use.
This may help, but it does not solve the real problem: after so much bitter experience, how could regulators have allowed this problem to recur, and why should they now be allowed to investigate?
On the Richter scale of drug disasters, the emerging crisis in antidepressants seems to be between 7 and 11, with Contergan reaching a 10.
Time will tell, but the crucial point is this: the Contergan disaster of the 1950 "s and 1960" s happened because there was no independent control of drug safety, while the crisis of antidepressants grew under the aegis of a sophisticated, expensive, and global regulatory system.
The crux of the antidepressant crisis is not that these drugs can do so much harm, but that they were approved when the precedents were so clear.
If this crisis is ever properly investigated, it will open not so much a box of pharmacological worms as questions about what medicine is and should be.
These underlying problems seem all the more important as the Internet has been groaning under the evidence of the coming crisis for several years.
The explosion of the Internet has led to entirely new ways of gathering, presenting, and communicating evidence.
It broadened and deepened the understanding of the problems associated with antidepressants and gave patients a collective voice like never before.
Previously, drug safety monitoring relied on occasional reports from health experts on patients "reactions to drugs.
But this crisis exposed the fundamental inadequacies of these reports, so that users "experiences with drugs can never again be credibly ignored.
United by the Internet, many thousands of patients from around the world began to describe experiences with antidepressants and withdrawal problems that bore little resemblance to the warnings of the labels.
The impact of this user intelligence is profound: in 2003, a pharmaceutical company revised its estimate of the frequency of withdrawal reactions from 0.2% to 25% (though the manufacturer of a similar drug continues to claim that it is "not a habit at all").
The crisis of antidepressants provides dramatic evidence for the first time of the collective value of user reports in understanding drug risk.
Of course, user reports are not "scientific" and most, individually, may seem naive, confused, exaggerated, false and / or simply self-absorbed.
But in this case, they collectively provided more reliable evidence than reported in numerous controlled clinical trials.
The question now is not so much the value of patient reports, but the integrity of medical research and the state of science.
"How corrupt has clinical medicine become," asked an editorial in the British medical journal The Lancet in 2002; the answer was "severe and damaging."
The duplicity in the marketing of antidepressants underlines how corrupt the profession has become.
The unfolding crisis raises broad questions about democracy and science, the relationship between risk and benefit, and the conflict between the imperatives of trade and health.
But one feature captures the underlying problem above all: the yawning gap between the words of the patients who express their opinions and the terminology of the producers, experts and authorities who speak out.
In the 1990 "s," depression "was formally redefined as the serotonin deficiency disease and scourge of millions of people - a convenient and seductive view, but deeply simplistic.
The term "drug addiction" has also been redefined to suggest that the loss of personal autonomy in a therapeutic environment may never occur.
The ubiquitous term "discontinuity symptoms" - Orwellian newspeak for withdrawal - implied that antidepressants carried no risk of dependency.
On the contrary, wishful thinking led experts to cite "discontinuity symptoms" as evidence of the efficacy of vital cures.
Suicides were later routinely described as "non-accidental overdoses," and the broad term "emotional instability" became fashionable, despite its inability to distinguish between a drug-related suicide attempt and a burst of tears.
By contrast, user reports of adverse reactions attempt to describe a human reality, rather than promoting images that correspond to particular interests.
In the long run, therefore, the crisis of antidepressants could prove a blessing in disguise, but only if it creates the transparency and intellectual honesty needed to hold the medical profession ultimately accountable to the people it purports to serve.
A man against the machine
WASHINGTON, DC - America's financial sector has shown renewed political strength in recent months, undermining most of the sensible proposals for banking reform that remain on the table.
If we are making any progress at all, it is because of the noble efforts of a small number of US senators.
Most remarkable is the work of Senator Ted Kaufman, a Democrat from Delaware (yes, a pro-business state), who has worked tirelessly to solve the most egregious problems in the US financial sector.
Kaufman understands that successful reform requires three ingredients: persuasive arguments, the ability to bring colleagues along, and a lot of luck in the form of events that pinpoint problems at just the right time.
On two fronts, Kaufman has actually succeeded in taking substantial steps against long odds.
Long before it became fashionable, Kaufman held fast to the notion that the US housing boom was fueled in part by pervasive fraud within the mortgage securitization derivatives complex that is virtually the heart of Wall Street.
This thesis is gaining traction: Major newspapers are now reporting an expansion of criminal investigations by the federal government and the New York State Attorney General against the US financial sector for the lending of residential real estate and related securities.
Kaufman, along with Senators Patrick Leahy and Chuck Grassley, worked last year to pass legislation that would provide timely resources to federal law enforcement agencies working on the latest financial scams.
More recently, Kaufman was scathing in his cross-examination of Goldman Sachs executives.
Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the subcommittee that heard her testimony and apparently agreed with Kaufman, was equally tough after a year-long investigation into Washington Mutual, Goldman and the abject failure of banking regulators and credit rating agencies.
Kaufman pulled off an even bigger coup by warning of the dangers of the explosive growth of high-frequency trading, which is poorly understood by America's main financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and represents a systemic market risk.
His concerns appear to have been confirmed by the 20-minute closing of trading in New York on May 6, when the stock market failed completely in its most basic function: pricing between buyers and sellers.
We do not yet know what combination of black box computer programs and electronic trading algorithms interacting in more than 50 market centers caused this disaster.
But our own lack of knowledge confirms how far our regulatory and supervisory capacity has lagged behind financial innovation.
Kaufman's approach - with speeches on the Senate floor as a central feature - seemed irrelevant or even odd to critics just a few weeks ago.
No significant voices on Wall Street recognized his concerns, preferring instead to praise stock markets as a shining example of well-functioning technology.
Now people get it.
As Senator Mark Warner graciously acknowledged, the senator from Delaware gave an early warning that the huge amounts of investment made by certain companies to try to gain an apparently fraction of a millisecond advantage in the trade process could come back and haunt us all... I was proud to follow his example.
The SEC was once a large and powerful independent agency.
It has been through tough times in recent decades and is only just beginning to turn the corner under new leadership.
Yet it still does not routinely collect the data it needs to understand the actions and effects of large traders by time and customer.
Kaufman has repeatedly urged them to do more, and much faster; she and many others, of course, are now listening.
On a third point, the results so far have been mixed.
Kaufman advocated downsizing America's largest banks as part of sweeping financial reforms.
His advocacy helped win support and forced a vote in the Senate on an amendment co-sponsored by Senator Sherrod Brown that imposed a hard cap on the size and leverage of banks (debt relative to assets).
The amendment was moderate and perfectly reasonable, but also failed on 6 May by 33 votes to 61.
Just days later, having witnessed the bailout of the eurozone's giant banks, senators might have received more support.
Still, it has bolstered support for another amendment supported by Senators Jeff Merkley and Carl Levin that would restrict proprietary trading by megabanks at their own expense - a practice that happens to be considered a large and dark part of high-speed trading.
The deeper and overriding point of Kaufman's critique of our system is the need for strict laws.
We cannot simply rely on regulators to do the right thing.
In particular, regulators have no chance to look beyond the horizon and act preemptively when markets are opaque and powerful Wall Street interests (and their Capitol Hill allies) can circle the wagons and claim that there is no problem.
Unfortunately, despite his newfound prominence on the national stage, Kaufman will leave office at the end of this year, having been named Vice President Joe Biden's successor at the end of 2008, when he pledged not to run for re-election.
If he goes, the dangerous elements on Wall Street will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief.
Let's hope that, by then, he has helped permanently shift the consensus among his colleagues, setting the stage for further congressional action aimed at seriously tightening financial-sector safeguards.
Kaufman's enduring legacy will be a simple and powerful idea that sensible people increasingly take for granted: relying on deregulation and self-interest in today's complex, opaque markets will obviously not produce sensible capital allocation or support entrepreneurship and growth.
We need to write and enforce laws that restore credibility to our financial markets.
A mania for diagnosing bipolar disorder
PROVIDENCE, RI < p > In recent years, many experts have pointed out that bipolar disorder - a serious illness that leads to significant psychosocial morbidity and excessive mortality - is underestimated, especially in patients with severe depression.
Even patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder often wait more than 10 years after the first treatment for the correct diagnosis.
Clinical implications of undetected bipolar disorder in depressed patients include under-prescribing mood-stabilizing drugs and an increased risk of rapid fluctuations between manic and depressive phases.
But, perhaps as a result of concerted efforts to improve the detection of bipolar disorders, we have witnessed the emergence in recent years of the opposite phenomenon of overdiagnosis.
In my own practice, my colleagues and I have met patients who have reported being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, even though they had no history of manic or hypomanic episodes.
Of course, we have also seen patients seeking treatment for depression and indeed suffering from bipolar disorder.
But there seemed to be more over-diagnosis than under-diagnosis.
We therefore conducted a study to empirically examine how often bipolar disorders could be over-diagnosed and under-diagnosed.
Seventy hundred outpatient psychiatric patients were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and completed a self-administered questionnaire asking whether they had previously been diagnosed by a physician with bipolar or manic-depressive disorder.
Information on family history was obtained from patients through their immediate relatives.
Slightly more than 20% (145 patients) in our sample indicated that they had previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, significantly more than the 12.9% rate based on SCID.
Less than half of those who reported having previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder were diagnosed with bipolar disorder based on the SCID.
Patients with SCID-diagnosed bipolar disorder had a significantly higher risk of bipolar disorder among their immediate family members than patients who themselves reported an earlier diagnosis of bipolar disorder that was not confirmed by SCID.
Patients who themselves reported an earlier diagnosis of bipolar disorder that was not confirmed by SCID did not have a significantly higher risk of bipolar disorder than patients who reacted negatively to bipolar disorder by self-reporting and SCID.
Our results, confirmed by family history, therefore suggest that bipolar disorder has been overdiagnosed.
Any study that seeks to determine whether a psychiatric disorder is overdiagnosed will find that some patients with the condition do not have it when they are re-interviewed.
That is the nature of the imperfect reliability of psychiatric diagnoses.
So the question is not whether some patients who have previously been diagnosed do not appear to have it when re-examined, but how many.
How high the percentage should be before overdiagnosis is a significant problem and a value judgment.
But we believe that an overdiagnosis of more than 50% exceeds the clinical significance threshold.
Over-diagnosis of bipolar disorder comes at a price.
Mood stabilizers are the treatment of choice, and, depending on the drug, they can potentially cause significant health complications that impair kidney, endocrine, hepatic, immunological, or metabolic function.
As a result, over-diagnosis of bipolar disorder can unnecessarily expose patients to serious side effects of medication.
The impact of marketing efforts by pharmaceutical companies and the public is likely to play a role in the emerging tendency to over-diagnose bipolar disorder.
Direct consumer advertising referring individuals to screening questionnaires can lead patients to suggest to their doctors that they suffer from bipolar disorder.
We have seen evidence of this in our practice.
This does not necessarily reflect a problem with conducting a screening questionnaire, but rather how these scales are used.
Screening questionnaires maximize sensitivity at the expense of false positives, because they are expected to be followed by expert clinical evaluation.
But insufficient diagnostic accuracy can lead to over-diagnosis.
Doctors tend to diagnose disorders that make them feel more comfortable.
We believe that the increasing availability of drugs approved to treat bipolar disorder may lead doctors who are unsure whether a patient is suffering from bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder to diagnose the drug-responsive disorder.
This bias is reinforced by pharmaceutical companies "marketing message to doctors, which emphasizes research into delayed diagnoses and under-diagnosis of bipolar disorders, and possibly sensitizes physicians accordingly.
The campaign against under-recognition has probably led to some anxious, agitated and / or irritated depressed patients complaining of insomnia and raging thoughts being wrongly diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
The results of our study are consistent with previous studies that suggest possible problems in diagnosing bipolar disorder. Given the greater number of drugs approved to treat bipolar disorder, and several reports warning physicians against underdiagnosis, overdiagnosis seems to have become a bigger problem than under-diagnosis.
Both can have negative consequences. Although there is still some uncertainty as to the best assessment approach, we recommend physicians to use a standardized, validated method.
A Marshall Plan for the Arab World
ROME - US President Barack Obama's major speech on the consequences of the Arab Spring is also a challenge for Europe.
Only if the transatlantic partnership proves effective, as it did to meet the demands of the Cold War and end the division of Europe, can the West contribute to the realization of the hopes raised by the Arab uprisings.
The crisis in Europe's southern neighbourhood reflects a profound transformation process that will have long-term consequences for the region, for Europe and for the world.
The Mediterranean is crucial for peace, stability and economic growth in Europe.
The countries bordering the Mediterranean see Europe as their natural partner.
And events there, including the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, have a broader impact, which of course requires close involvement of global partners, led by the United States.
Current events not only in Libya, but also in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, and Bahrain reflect the political complexity of these countries.
They also stem from various factors, such as frustration with rising food prices and widespread corruption, coupled with demands for greater democratization, reduction of economic and social inequalities, and job creation.
Europe's response to this process must embody the goal of an orderly and rapid transition.
Proposals for a kind of "transformation partnership" based on political reform and full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms should take into account that the political landscape in the region will certainly remain volatile and tense in the coming months.
Not surprisingly, regional stability has become a high priority for Europeans.
Chaos, a resurgence of terrorism, the rise of radical Islamism and massive waves of immigration into Europe are just some of the potential threats to the European Union that are currently being considered.
In view of this, the EU should do its utmost to prevent deterioration of security in the region.
Just as the post-1945 Marshall Plan consisted of a financial assistance package aimed at rebuilding and revitalizing Western European economies to support democratic change and political stability, the Arab Spring countries face similar challenges and needs.
We must enable countries such as Egypt and Tunisia, and possibly a peaceful Libya, to strengthen their political stability through democratisation.
The Marshall Plan was accompanied by reconstruction partnerships in which the US and the European recipient countries were on an equal footing.
The aim was to strengthen cooperation as a means of establishing lasting peace.
The situation in the Mediterranean is more advanced, the foundations for a partnership are already in place, so it is now time to move forward with the integration of Europe with its southern neighbours.
That is why Italy has proposed a new EU plan for the Mediterranean to support the transition process and build on existing institutional and financial instruments to provide additional resources to the region.
Launched in 2008 by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the Union for the Mediterranean must be revitalised and directed towards development projects ranging from motorways and ports to the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
But a broader economic initiative is also needed to mobilise a critical mass of European and international financial resources to attract investment to the region and modernise its infrastructure and services.
Together with the United States, let us break down the trade and economic barriers that are stifling these economies.
Let us also give some Mediterranean countries association status, which will allow them to gradually integrate into the EU's internal market and participate in EU programmes.
Clear principles are needed to achieve all this.
We Europeans must promote stability, create a genuine spirit of co-responsibility and promote political responsibility; in this new framework, the EU should avoid excessive conditionality, especially during the transition period.
Europe's strong support for the region's economic development must remain a top priority as Arab countries embark on necessary reforms.
In addition, a dedicated financial institution should be set up to support this task.
A proposal worth considering is the upgrading and strengthening of the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP) of the European Investment Bank, which would become an autonomous institution, perhaps based in the Middle East or North Africa, whose shares would be held by the governments of the region (or other institutions) and other willing parties.
The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development could join these efforts by extending its activities to the region, which could involve the creation of specialized services to support job-creating businesses "growth.
The EBRD has made an important contribution to the economic transition process in Eastern Europe and there is good reason to use its experience and know-how to help the Southern Mediterranean.
At the same time, the EU must launch a "dialogue of equals" on political and security issues aimed at building trust throughout the region.
A Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East (CSCM) could quickly become a useful tool for promoting this comprehensive approach to security and development.
In short, we need to transform the Mediterranean countries into producers, not consumers of regional stability.
We Europeans cannot afford to turn our backs on our Arab friends on the distant shores of the Mare Nostrum.
They are part of our collective history and they deserve a better future that we can help them build.
A Middle East Union?
TOLEDO, SPAIN - This fall, the Toledo International Peace Center convened a meeting devoted to water cooperation in the Middle East.
One conclusion was that any effective response to the unequal distribution of natural resources in the region must be regional.
With this idea in mind, Munther Haddadin, a former Jordanian minister of water resources, proposed a "Water and Energy Union" for the Middle East, a long-term mechanism for integrating a fragmented region.
The idea is compelling.
There is a strong logic to addressing such basic needs in a way that addresses scarcity and surpluses at regional level.
Indeed, the parallels with the role of coal and steel in the creation of the European Union are clear enough that the former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer has called for such a union in recent months.
The same is true of former Czech President Václav Havel and a group of global luminaries who support the idea of regional integration through water.
Having convened the meeting in Spain, we are very much in favour of pursuing such an honourable objective.
But the European Coal and Steel Union became possible only after Europe's major political conflicts were resolved.
A successful process of regional integration in the Middle East also requires a political framework that ensures the stability necessary for regional cooperation to work.
All sides must know where their borders begin and end, and past injustices must be set aside so that the cycle of revenge and automatic reflex for immediate gains does not frustrate regional problem-solving.
Here, the experience of a previous regional exercise is commendable.
In the 1990s, the multilateral track of the Middle East Peace Process pursued regional coordination on economic development, the environment, refugees, arms control, and water.
It failed because, with the collapse of bilateral talks, the willingness to cooperate regionally faded under the desperation of the failed policies and the bloody reality of the Second Intifada.
The necessary political framework must also be regional, and fortunately it exists.
The Arab Peace Initiative, first presented at an Arab League summit in Beirut in 2002 and endorsed in Riyadh in 2007, provides a framework for all parties to resolve their differences and a political basis for moving forward.
Their adoption is essential to make progress, especially if additional chapters on regional security and economic relations are to be included.
Despite today's chronic pessimism, the pursuit of a water and energy union in the Middle East, coupled with the adoption of the Arab Peace Initiative, would change minds.
Together, they would form a mutually reinforcing process: a political agreement would provide the framework within which the region's water and energy needs could be met; and the effective and innovative response to these basic needs would make the Arab Peace Initiative more than a paper agreement.
Moreover, the arid triangle formed by Israel, Palestine and Jordan can meet its water needs only if another dimension is included in the solution.
A World Bank report has already stated that, with 19 million people living between the Jordan and the Mediterranean by 2020, water needs cannot be met without making existing desalination technologies more economically viable.
Coincidentally, there were early signs last month of greater interest in a regional policy approach.
The Bahraini foreign minister recently called for a regional forum involving Israel to resolve the outstanding issues; a former senior Saudi official met with Israelis in the UK to reaffirm the need for a comprehensive peace agreement; and the leader of the Israeli Labour Party, Ehud Barak, has said that it may be time to seek a comprehensive peace agreement for the region, accompanied by an economic package, as separate negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians may prove fruitless.
Despite decades of effort, the process of trying and erring through bilateral and conflict-management approaches has always ended in frustration.
Whatever economic projects have been launched has crumbled in the face of the continued occupation.
The problems are too complex and the dangers of radicalism too advanced to allow success by arbitrary means.
The Middle East can only end its state of permanent crisis if it creates a comprehensive basis for peace.
The Arab Peace Initiative, together with the long-term development of a Water and Energy Union, provides the necessary basis for meeting the needs of the peoples of the region and defusing future conflicts.
The Middle East must no longer be a hallmark of persistent violence.
It can be a harbinger of innovation on issues of common human interest - water, energy, and politics.
A misaligned euro?
CAMBRIDGE - The European Central Bank (ECB) has raised interest rates again, owing to rising oil prices and a soaring dollar.
More to follow.
Growth is wonderful; inflation is terrible; a central bank cannot help but decide: it must restore price stability, even if that means sacrificing growth.
That is what lies ahead, unless there is sudden relief from an upturn in the euro.
But is it realistic to expect a rally from a currency that has been under siege since its birth?
When it was launched, the euro reached impressive heights, such as a high-tech IPO.
But the IPO soon went miserably wrong.
Since its launch, the euro has fallen further from its peak than even the Nasdaq in the high-tech sell-off earlier this year.
As with the Nasdaq's high-tech high-flyers, the nagging questions are about the euro: What is its fundamental value?
Is there a fundamental misalignment of the euro against other currencies (in particular the dollar) and how long could this take?
It is widely assumed (but no one is making big bets) that the Nasdaq still carries big downside risks, while the euro must sooner or later return to normal, whatever that means.
Could the opposite happen?
A recent IMF study reports equilibrium exchange rates derived from models of long-term factors in currency valuations.
Equilibrium interest rates are shown in the attached table, as are current interest rates.
According to these IMF theoretical equilibrium rates, the euro is grossly misaligned: 30% undervalued against the dollar, 18% against the yen!
I'm not sure what the answer is.
Actual IMF equilibrium rate
Dollars / Euro ($/ _) 0,88 1,26
Yen / Euro (- / _) 93.1 113.3
I'm not sure what the answer is.
In assessing whether these theoretical values indicate a major rebalancing of the euro, let us see what causes it.
Above all, these equilibrium rates are based on a theoretical model in which long-term current-account balances tend toward zero.
In this scenario, any country with persistently high current-account balances faces a hard landing and a correction in the value of its currency.
No country can borrow forever, or at least at very high interest rates.
But do current-account restrictions apply to large, financially stable countries?
Canada has had all but three current-account deficits in the last 50 years, and the US has had none for 30 years.
As long as a borrowing country is stable and attractive, the market will not force a major reversal on the current account.
This is America's story: despite a yawning trade deficit, investment is in full swing and eagerly financed by the rest of the world; public finances are huge and inflation insignificant; the prospects for the new economy are unbroken; and asset markets show that even if there is a US bubble, it is unlikely to burst as violently as Japan did a decade ago.
In such an environment, long-term equilibrium-rate models are pretty useless as a guide to short- or even medium-term exchange-rate developments.
The second limitation of long-term models is that they are historically estimated and therefore do not take into account dramatic changes in the supply side or the financial environment.
Japan, for example, is in the grip of a growth crisis and public-finance disaster - not the usual companions of an appreciating currency.
On the dollar / euro front, the US has embarked on an unprecedented productivity trend; regardless of the current account, the upswing in American productivity (combined with financial stability) is the dominant feature regardless of the current account.
The counterpart, because exchange rates are always based on divergent developments, is persistently poor supply performance in Europe and Japan, which implies prolonged and pervasive economic distress.
There is a third reason why estimates of the long-term balance with the current account balance may be of little predictive value.
Do Europe and Japan really want the US to achieve an external balance?
Europe and Japan, and indeed the entire emerging-market world, live off America's trade deficits.
They make the world grow!
If there was a risk that the private sector would continue to finance these deficits, the ECB and the Bank of Japan would step in and buy all the dollars that their private sector had shunned.
There is a precedent for this: whenever the dollar weakens, foreign central banks are eager to help.
As John Connally, President Nixon's treasury secretary 30 years ago, said, "The dollar is our money and their problem."
There is little chance that exchange rates will converge with the IMF any time soon.
Yes, the euro may move towards dollar parity.
But it is also plausible that a lack of support for the euro and the ongoing US miracle will cause the euro to fall to exceptionally low levels of near 0.80 and even less.
For the time being, investors will continue to view the euro as a problem, as will the ECB.
The euro's initial public offering crashed because it took place at a time when the US economy was soaring.
The European product will make it; it will have its day in the sun.
But now?
She has no chance to shine.
A more perfect monetary union
WARSAW - The eurozone is often seen as an experiment in monetary union without political unification.
Those who make this claim seem to have in mind a model of a single state that has two relevant features: limited fiscal sovereignty for regional and local governments, and a substantial common budget from which regions affected by asymmetric shocks can receive transfers.
Those who claim that "political union" is necessary for the eurozone seem to be focusing on the second feature, despite the fact that fiscal constraints are clearly a typical and important component of individual states for local governments.
In this sense, they are ignoring the fact that the Stability and Growth Pact of the European Union was, in principle, an important part of political union and not its replacement.
Indeed, the eurozone's current fiscal problems stem not from the lack of a large common budget, but from weak enforcement of the Pact.
More fundamentally, monetary unions "broadly" existed not only within individual states, but also in groups of sovereign states, the gold standard being the most notable example in history.
Experience with such monetary unions offers two lessons.
First, they demanded fiscal discipline in member states, which was below the gold standard with its informal balanced-budget norm.
Secondly, they existed without tax transfers from a common centre, because such a centre did not exist.
Instead, a high degree of flexibility, including within their labor markets, facilitated adjustment to asymmetric shocks.
It is clear that there is no scope for an extension of the EU budget in the foreseeable future to increase tax transfers to eurozone countries affected by sharp declines in consumption.
This would require a greater degree of European identity that the Union's political elites cannot artificially create.
But the crucial point is not that a large common budget is politically impossible in the eurozone, but that it would not solve the main problem: the weakness of the mechanisms that ensure fiscal discipline in member states.
Instead of focusing on the wrong model of a one-size-fits-all state, the EU and its member states should focus on the conditions needed for a monetary union that does not have a common budget to compensate for asymmetric shocks to function properly.
Firstly, strengthening mechanisms aimed at preventing pro-cyclical policies and major fiscal shocks should be a top priority.
This requires ensuring the credibility and transparency of accounting rules that define budget deficits and sovereign debt, with closer monitoring also focusing on the development of asset bubbles that cause deep recessions when they burst, causing large increases in budget deficits.
Likewise, the European Central Bank's monetary policy should brace itself against the wind by paying more attention to asset-price bubbles.
Because the ECB's common monetary policy cannot fit the macroeconomic conditions of all member states, eurozone countries need macroprudential regulations aimed at reducing excessive credit growth.
In the meantime, the Stability and Growth Pact should be strictly enforced, implying the use and strengthening of the sanctions available.
Of course, initiatives at the EU and / or eurozone levels cannot replace stronger disciplinary mechanisms in member states, which are ultimately the responsibility of national policymakers and the public.
However, in order to stimulate the growth of preventive mechanisms in member states, EU-wide measures to ensure discipline are needed, and such initiatives are largely dependent on the large countries, which therefore bear a particular responsibility for developments within the eurozone and within the EU.
Second, in addition to strengthening economic institutions, EU countries must accelerate structural reforms to improve their long-term growth prospects and facilitate their smooth adjustment to shocks.
The former are needed to help EU members emerge from their increased public debt, while the latter would help them combat unemployment.
Of the many necessary measures in this area, the most important are a vigorous effort to complete the internal market and to avoid economic nationalism at all costs.
Furthermore, the Lisbon Agenda should be revitalised, with a focus on market reforms, and the EU should urgently reconsider measures - particularly in relation to climate policy and drifting towards an EU-wide social policy - that risk imposing additional burdens on their economies and / or hindering market flexibility.
In this respect, the mode of budgetary reform is fundamental.
Since the tax burden on EU members is already high, further tax increases would weaken the forces of growth.
Tax reform should therefore focus on reducing the growth of expenditure commitments, including raising the retirement age in view of the ageing of EU societies.
Finally, rigid labor markets and, more generally, regulatory constraints on prices and the economy's supply response reinforce recessionary responses to various shocks and contribute to rising unemployment.
Liberalisation of the labour market should therefore be a high priority and a further focus of the revitalised Lisbon Agenda.
The European elites like to invoke "European solidarity, social cohesion" and the "European social model."
Strengthen Brazil's Soft Power
BRAZIL - For Brazil's citizens, it is perhaps a truism that their country is, and always will be, peaceful.
After all, Brazil has lived conflict-free with its ten neighbors for almost 150 years, having negotiated its borders.
It last fought war in 1942, after direct aggression by Nazi submarines in the South Atlantic.
It has renounced nuclear weapons and signed a comprehensive nuclear safety agreement with Argentina and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Through the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) and the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), Brazil contributes to the political, economic, social and cultural integration of the region.
But is soft power enough for one of the world's largest emerging economies?
To be sure, Brazil's peaceful foreign policy has served her well.
Brazil has used its greatness to advance peace and cooperation in South America and beyond.
His constructive attitude stems from a worldview that places high value on the values of democracy, social justice, economic development and environmental protection.
Brazil's unique approach to promoting these ideals is an important source of its soft power, reflected in the broad international support that put Brazilians at the forefront of international institutions such as the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Trade Organization.
But no country can rely on soft power alone to defend its interests.
Indeed, in an unpredictable world, where old threats are reinforced by new challenges, politicians cannot ignore hard power.
By deterring threats to national sovereignty, military power supports peace; and, in the case of Brazil, it underpins our country's constructive role in the pursuit of global stability.
This role is more necessary than ever.
Over the last two decades, unilateral action, in defiance of the primary responsibility of the UN Security Council in matters of war and peace, has led to greater insecurity and instability.
Likewise, little progress toward nuclear disarmament has been made in defiance of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Brazil's energy, food, water, and biodiversity wealth increases its share of a security environment characterized by increasing competition for access to or control over natural resources.
To meet the challenges of this complex reality, Brazil's peaceful foreign policy must be underpinned by a robust defense policy.
Brazil's National Defense Strategy, updated in 2012, states that military modernization is inextricably linked to national development.
It therefore stresses the need to strengthen the national defence industry.
In line with the strategy, Brazil is enhancing its conventional deterrence capabilities, including by building a nuclear-powered submarine as part of a naval program that lives up to its responsibilities in the South Atlantic.
Brazil coordinates closely with its neighbors on defense issues, both bilaterally and through Unasur's South American Defence Council, which aims to promote confidence-building, transparency, a common regional defense industry, and, above all, a common defense identity.
One potential mechanism for advancing these goals is a South American Defense College, which is being considered.
South America is becoming a region where war is unthinkable - what the political scientist Karl Deutsch once called a "security community."
Having visited every South American country during my tenure as Defence Minister, I am convinced that the most effective deterrent on the continent is cooperation.
At the same time, Brazil is pursuing increased bilateral defense cooperation with African partners.
Brazil is working closely with our neighbors on both sides of the South Atlantic to strengthen the Zone of Peace and Cooperation in the South Atlantic (ZPCSA), which aims to keep the ocean free of rivalries and nuclear weapons.
Brazil is also addressing other emerging economies such as the other BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and members of the IBSA Dialogue Forum (India, Brazil and South Africa).
Brazil, for example, conducts IBSAMAR, a regular trilateral naval exercise with South Africa and India.
More broadly, we are exploring the possibilities of cooperation in the joint development of defence technologies.
Through such efforts, Brazil hopes to contribute to a more balanced international order, less subject to hegemony of any kind, without losing sight of the importance of mutually beneficial partnerships with developed countries.
Even as Brazil hardens its soft power, it remains firmly committed to the path of dialogue, conflict prevention and negotiated settlement of disputes.
The presence of Brazilian peacekeepers in countries such as Haiti and Lebanon underscores Brazil's contribution to maintaining peace and security worldwide.
In the twenty-first century, a truly stable world order will depend on a legitimate and effective UN Security Council that reflects the plurality of the emerging multipolar world.
China grows together
HONG KONG - For more than three decades, China's GDP has been growing at an average annual rate of more than 10%.
But former Premier Wen Jiabao rightly described this impressive growth performance as "unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable," stressing the many economic, social, and environmental costs and challenges that it entailed.
China must now choose between the export-oriented, investment-oriented growth model of the past and a new, more viable economic order.
Cheap credit and perverse incentives, such as promotions for the civil servants who contribute the most to GDP growth, have led to massive but unnecessary investment, which in turn has contributed to excess capacity in manufacturing and infrastructure.
Not only is this model inefficient; channeling state resources to promote investment also undermines China's social development.
Given this, China's leaders have decided to stop using GDP growth as the primary criterion for assessing officials "performance.
Indeed, the 12th Five-Year Plan, which runs until 2015, aims to shift China's economy to a new, more sustainable growth model based on quality and innovation, and assumes that annual GDP growth is likely to fall to 7% during the transition.
Most discussions about growth models today are based on work by Nobel laureate Robert Solow.
For Solow, GDP growth is determined by the input of land, labor, and capital, along with macroeconomic factor productivity (TFP, or change in output, which is taken into account not by changes in input volume, but by factors such as technological innovation and institutional reform).
Since 1978, China has achieved three phases of high TFP growth of 5-7 years each, through the implementation of key reforms.
First, annual TFP growth accelerated to 3-4% in the early 1980 "s after the introduction of the rural household responsibility system, which boosted agricultural productivity and released a large amount of unskilled labor to work in the more productive urban and industrial sectors.
The second such period followed Deng Xiaoping's tour of the South in 1992, during which he emphasized the need to move to a market-based, if state-controlled, system by opening China's economy to foreign direct investment and establishing special economic zones to support the development of export-oriented industries.
This time, TFP growth soared to 5-6%, owing in part to the catching-up process facilitated by China's adoption of foreign technology and know-how.
After all, China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, following major reforms of state-owned enterprises and the tax system.
Because the country was fully integrated into global supply chains, TFP growth reached 4%, where it remained until 2007.
Since then, however, the TFP growth rate has fallen by almost half.
Indeed, China's economy has experienced a marked and sustained slowdown in growth in the wake of the global economic crisis that erupted five years ago.
By 2012, human capital's contribution to China's GDP growth had fallen almost to zero, with fixed capital accumulation accounting for about 60% of total growth.
Large-scale debt-financed capital investment has boosted the country's credit-to-GDP ratio to nearly 200%, increasing the vulnerability of the financial system - a development reflected in the recent rise in interbank interest rates.
To achieve more balanced and sustainable GDP growth, China's leaders must implement a series of deep, comprehensive, and long-term institutional reforms aimed at boosting the TFP.
In particular, reforms should be designed to facilitate China's transition from its traditional supply-based growth model, which assumes that building hard infrastructure automatically leads to demand growth.
Indeed, GDP growth may slow precisely because existing investment in manufacturing and infrastructure, largely by local governments and state-owned enterprises, does not match the pattern of domestic demand.
As a result, China now faces the problem of short-term overcapacity.
Improving the quality of GDP growth will depend on the willingness of China's leaders to implement market-oriented reforms.
Rather than driving investment directly, governments must emphasize their regulatory and enforcement functions, including setting and monitoring standards, building an effective property-rights infrastructure, and managing macroeconomic conditions.
At the same time, the state must improve the quality and delivery of education, health care, and security, while minimizing corruption and administrative abuse.
In short, China must shift its focus from meeting GDP growth targets to creating an environment that fosters innovation and competition, thereby enabling market forces to set prices and allocate resources more effectively.
The state would thus become an intermediary facilitating the development of a sustainable economic order in which less is more, that is, a system in which fewer interventions create more opportunities for creativity.
SOEs undoubtedly played an important role in China's earlier growth model, providing the infrastructure and services that were deemed necessary for the functioning of the global production supply chain.
But access to cheap credit from state-controlled banks creates an incentive for SOEs to generate excess capacity, which increases systemic risk in the economy.
To address China's overcapacity problem, the companies concerned, whether state-owned or private, would have to exit the market.
Unless China's leaders implement major structural reforms aimed at establishing a market-based growth model, they will be unable to avoid the "middle-income trap" that has prevented so many developing countries from achieving advanced-country status.
The slowdown in GDP growth that such reforms would cause would be more than offset by increased market dynamics and overall economic stability.
A movable financial feast
LONDON < br > There was a time when league tables were only on the sports pages of newspapers.
Today, they are a global obsession.
There are tables for schools and universities, corporate profitability or corporate social responsibility rankings, tables for happiness indicators by country and tables that classify consumer brands by value.
There is even a ranking of the funniest jokes in the world (I didn't laugh much).
The financial world is also full of such rankings.
Investment bankers eagerly await the league table of mergers and acquisitions, though the link between high rank and profitability lies somewhere between casual and nonexistent.
Bank tables have been around for a while, and they now tend to be based on capital strength rather than investment volume, which is a kind of improvement, but still not very meaningful.
In the meantime, there are also several different league tables, which cause considerable unrest and classify financial centres largely on the basis of business surveys.
How much the financial crisis has damaged the reputation and performance of the major Western centers is a question that is increasingly being asked in London, and to a lesser extent in New York. (Some Americans tend to believe that the world will show them a way out, no matter how badly they are received when they arrive!)
So far, the message from the latest spreadsheets is not too alarming for the incumbents.
A ranking prepared for the City Corporation in London shows that New York and London are still at the top of the league.
Banker magazine publishes another, with New York at the top and London second, although the gap between them and their pursuers is narrowing.
In both London and New York, the quality and intensity of regulation and the tax burden have declined.
Businesses seem nervous about the future in both areas.
The most striking change in the ranking is the rise of Asia's major financial centers - not just Hong Kong and Singapore, but also Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen.
The Chinese have explicitly promoted their financial centers, and the effects are beginning to show.
The World Economic Forum's (WEF) Financial Development Index, another league table to consider, shows Hong Kong and Singapore very close to London, with China now ahead of Italy in overall financial sophistication.
Noodles beat spaghetti.
Some of it is not surprising.
As the world's economic center of gravity shifts eastward, the balance of financial activity will inevitably shift.
Based on the principle that it is prudent, if something is inevitable, to welcome it, the appropriate response in London and New York is to find ways of working with these new centres.
But the more important question for traditional financial centers is whether international activities that can move are really moving.
It's much harder to judge.
There are anecdotes about individual hedge fund managers who have moved to Geneva.
Every time a government or regulator announces a new inspection or tightening of existing controls, there are threats from bankers to pack up and leave town and take their Porsches and mistresses with them.
These threats, which once had major political repercussions, are now much less effective.
Some politicians and commentators are quick to say "good riddance." Even the Bank of England has asked whether hosting a global financial market is worth it, given the cost of cleaning up the mess caused by the recent crisis.
These are risky speculations.
No matter how badly bankers have behaved - and some undoubtedly deserve a decade or more in sin - financial services are a vital part of the London economy.
If the financial sector shrinks, what will replace it in terms of employment?
The airy talk of science and manufacturing as ladders out of recession (a favourite image of former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown) is just an empty phrase.
There are few, if any, examples of high-cost post-industrial societies reviving their manufacturing sector on a large scale after its decline.
London, in particular, has no inalienable right to be a global financial center.
After all, the UK's internal market is much smaller than that of the United States.
Indeed, the state of financial activity has changed over the centuries.
If incumbency were a permanent advantage, Goldman Sachs "global headquarters would be in Babylon.
There must be a tipping point at which a combination of higher taxes, more regulation, and a hostile political climate leads financial firms to relocate.
The danger is that Britain is now approaching that point.
That is why the UK's Financial Services Authority, and even the Confederation of British Industry, which campaigns overwhelmingly for companies outside the financial sector that are worried about access to credit, have begun to call for a truce between the authorities and the financial markets.
The next two or three months will determine whether peace breaks out and, if so, whether it will last.
As always in peace negotiations, both sides must be willing to compromise.
Businesses will have to show visible restraint in this year's bonus round.
The British Government will not tolerate any further turmoil.
And governments on both sides of the Atlantic will have to decide how far to go in punishing banks.
Continued threats of ever-increasing tax burdens could prove dangerously counterproductive.
If we do not soon agree on a new social contract between the state and the markets, these markets could indeed move elsewhere.
A Murder in Moscow
It is time to end the fiction that Vladimir Putin's "dictatorship of law" has made post-communist Russia less lawless.
The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one of Russia's bravest and best journalists, a woman who dared to expose the brutal murders of Russian troops in Chechnya, is definitive proof that President Putin has delivered nothing more than a milling dictatorship with the usual disregard for the law.
This recognition is timely for the world, especially for Europe.
The German Foreign Ministry is preparing a policy of Russian-German relations that enshrines indifference to Putin's lawlessness in the national interest of the European Union's most powerful member.
But indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages Putin to pursue his lawless ways in the international arena, as in his current campaign to strangle Georgia's economy.
Politkovskaya's assassination has unleashed an eerie sense of déjà vu: just as in the heyday of the KGB, people in Putin's Russia simply disappear.
Politkovskaya's death is the third politically motivated murder in three weeks.
Enver Ziganshin, chief engineer of BP Russia, was shot dead in Irkutsk on 30 September.
Andrei Kozlov, deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia and leader of a campaign against financial fraud, was assassinated on 14 September.
The fact that Russia's Prosecutor General, Yuri Chaika, has taken over the investigation into Politkovskaya's murder, as he did with the murder of Kozlov, gives no cause for hope, as would be the case in any true democracy at the highest level.
Indeed, the involvement of top Russian officials is almost a guarantee that the killers will never be found.
The murder of Politkovskaya is a particularly grim portent, given that she was a powerful critic of the Russian president.
In her articles for one of Moscow's few remaining independent newspapers, Novaya Gazeta, and in her books "Putin's Russia: Living in a Failing Democracy" and "A Dirty War: A Russian Reporter in Chechnya," Politkovskaya wrote about the waning freedoms that are the hallmark of Putin's presidency.
As the exile of former media magnates Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinki and the imprisonment of oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky demonstrate, Putin's enemies face three fates: exile, prison, or grave.
I am not accusing Putin's government of the contract murder of Politkovskaya.
After all, as an investigative journalist alongside Putin during the election campaign, she enraged many people, not least current Chechen Prime Minister Ramzan Kadyrov, whom she accused of pursuing a policy of kidnapping for ransom.
But even if Vladimir Putin's aides had nothing to do with Politkovskaya being shot in the elevator of her apartment building in central Moscow, his disregard for the law created the climate in which the murder was committed.
Like the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury cathedral many centuries ago, the crime was committed in the clear belief that the king would like it.
Given what Politkovskaya represented as the responsibility of a democratic press to challenge the Kremlin and its policies, the government should have ensured that nothing bad happened to it.
Putin's Russia has already lost 12 leading journalists to murder in the past six years.
None of these crimes has been solved, which would not be the case if Putin's "dictatorship of law" were more than a PR strategy.
The six years since Vladimir Putin took office in the Kremlin have been a time of profoundly conflicting signals.
On the one hand, the world sees a young, educated leader who promises to modernize Russia, especially with a view to aligning its law enforcement and judicial practices with international norms.
On the other hand, the president watches in silence as his former counterparts in Russia's FSB (the former KGB) provide no security for the murdered and launch a series of notorious espionage cases against journalists, scientists, and environmental activists.
These "neo-spies" include journalist Gregory Pasko, arms control expert Igor Sutyagin, diplomat Valentin Moiseyev, physicist Valentin Danilov, and others.
The supposed civilizing influence of being a Western partner, for example, chairing a G-8 summit in St Petersburg, seems to have been lost in Putin's Kremlin cabinet.
Once again, Western values have spawned another Potemkin village.
Russia presents a façade of laws and democratic institutions, but behind this surface, the same arbitrary powers prevail.
The danger for the world is that Putin's lawlessness will be exported.
Across Russia and abroad, a form of criminalized diplomacy has taken root.
Consider Putin's attempt to manipulate Ukraine's previous presidential election, and the repeated criminal charges against opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
Consider the breakaway regions of Moldova and Georgia, which exist only thanks to Kremlin support.
Look at how the Kremlin is trying to blackmail its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies.
Every police officer knows that criminals become braver when they ignore criminal behaviour.
It is high time the world recognised Vladimir Putin for what he is: a man who is leading Russia back into the shadows.
So the world must now reflect on the old Latin maxim qui tacet consentere videtur - "silence means consent" - and ask itself whether it is wise to tacitly endorse Putin's construction of a lawless energy superpower.
A Kidnapped Nation
The July 6 editorial in Colombia's Diario del Sur ("A slap in the face of violence") was ecstatic: "Never before, despite the violence that has oppressed us for so many years, has Colombia experienced a day like yesterday: historic and unforgettable in every sense."
At noon on July 5, Colombians across the country took to the streets to express outrage at the news that eleven provincial politicians had been killed while being held by leftist rebels.
A human chain was formed, whose participants wore white tops.
My colleagues in the capital, Bogota, and in the south of the country, where we have humanitarian projects, say that everyone was waving white scarves.
White balloons were launched everywhere.
Press agencies estimate that with more than a million participants, it was the largest public protest since October 1999, which was also a demonstration against violence and kidnappings.
But while the murder of the eleven congressmen from the Cali region, attributed to "crossfire" during an attack by an "unidentified military group" of leftist rebels, provoked shock and anger, there was no agreement on how to resolve the chronic problem of "El Secuestro" (The Kidnapping).
Some Colombians are calling for a "humanitarian agreement," a prisoner exchange for hostages, and rejecting rescue attempts with blood and fire.
Others oppose the "transfer of territory" (the establishment of a demilitarised zone in which such an exchange could take place) and demand of the government "firmeza, siempre firmeza!" (to be firm and to persecute the rebels).
As is so often the case in armed conflicts, civilians suffer most.
The July 5 protests reminded us of the 3,000 kidnappings since the beginning of this four-decade conflict, but Colombians could form human chains and release white balloons for many other reasons.
Consider Colombia's dismal ranking of the number of casualties from landmines.
According to Landmine Monitor 2006, Colombia had 1,110 victims last year, followed by Cambodia with 875 and Afghanistan with 848.
This unnoticed drama is emblematic of the little-noticed Colombian conflict.
If there was such a thing as a combined index of despair, Colombia would be unchallenged at the top.
Hostage-taking, killing, and mutilation by landmines are only the side effects of Latin America's oldest and longest-running civil war, which has displaced three million internally - one of the highest numbers of refugees in the world, similar to those in Sudan, Congo, and Iraq.
Even if, miraculously, the fighting comes to a negotiated end, the scars left by the conflict will remain.
In addition to helping the country find a political solution, it is therefore necessary to focus on long-term reconstruction and reconciliation, so that young lives distorted by the civil war can be repaired and children saved from the harmful effects of so much violence and bloodshed.
In southern Colombia, where the strong presence of illegal armed groups makes social peace a distant dream, I visited a secondary school as part of a needs assessment.
After four hours on a dirt road I reached a hamlet in the highlands.
The smart and friendly teenagers were eager to learn how to surf the Internet that had just been installed in their school.
But when I asked five of them what they wanted to become, I understood that this conflict has shaped them forever.
Her dream jobs were: lawyer, detective, coroner and soldier.
The fifth wanted to become a chemist to set up a cocaine laboratory.
The teenagers "plans merely reflect a sad reality: these students are the second generation to have experienced nothing but war.
On the day of the March Against Violence, alongside the editorial in the Diario del Sur, there was a simple survey with just one question: "Do you think security [in our capital] has improved since the beginning of the year?"
That's why thousands took to the streets to be counted.
Maybe it's a start.
A Nation of Vidiots
NEW YORK - The last half-century has been the age of electronic mass media.
Television has transformed society in all parts of the world.
Now comes an explosion of new media devices to TV: DVDs, computers, gaming boxes, smartphones, and more.
The United States led the world into the television age, and the consequences are most immediate in America's long love affair with what Harlan Ellison memorably called "the glass teat."
In 1950, less than 8% of American households owned a television, compared with 90% in 1960.
Elsewhere, it took decades longer to reach that level, and the poorest countries are still not there.
In fact, Americans have become, and probably still are, the largest television viewers, even if the data is somewhat patchy and incomplete.
The best evidence suggests that Americans watch more than five hours of TV a day on average - a staggering amount when you consider that several hours more is spent in front of other video-streaming devices.
Other countries have significantly fewer hours of vision; in Scandinavia, for example, the time spent watching TV is about half the US average.
The consequences for American society are profound, disturbing, and a warning to the world, even if it is probably far too late to be heeded.
First, heavy TV viewing brings little joy.
Many surveys show that it is almost like an addiction, with short-term benefits that lead to long-term dissatisfaction and regret, and such viewers say they would rather see less than they do.
Moreover, heavy television consumption has contributed to social fragmentation.
Time that used to be spent together in the community is now spent alone in front of the screen.
Robert Putnam, the leading scholar on America's declining sense of community, has found that television consumption is the central explanation for the decline of "social capital," the trust that holds communities together.
Americans simply trust each other less than they did a generation ago.
Of course, there are many other factors at play, but TV-related social atomization should not be underestimated.
To be sure, heavy TV viewing is bad for physical and mental health.
Americans lead the world in obesity, with about two-thirds of the US population now overweight.
Again, many factors underlie this, including a diet of cheap, unhealthy fried foods, but sedentary time in front of the TV is also an important influence.
At the same time, what happens mentally is just as important as what happens physically.
Television and related media have been the largest purveyors and purveyors of corporate and political propaganda in society.
America's television stations are almost entirely privately owned, and their owners make much of their money from relentless advertising.
Effective advertising campaigns that address unconscious urges typically related to food, sex, and status create cravings for products and purchases that have little real value for consumers or society.
The same has happened to politics, of course.
American politicians today are brand names, packaged like breakfast cereals.
Each and every idea can be sold with a colorful band and a catchy jingle.
All roads to power in America lead through television, and all access to television depends on big money.
This simple logic has put American politics in the hands of the rich as never before.
Even war can be introduced as a new product.
The Bush administration propagated the premises of the Iraq War, Saddam Hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction, in the familiar colorful, fast-paced and graphic style of television advertising.
Then the war itself began with the so-called "shock and awe" bombing of Baghdad, a live televised spectacle designed to secure high ratings for the US-led invasion.
Many neuroscientists believe that the impact of TV viewing on mental health may run even deeper than addiction, consumerism, loss of social trust, and political propaganda.
Perhaps television rewires viewers "brains and impairs their cognitive abilities.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recently warned that watching television in young children is dangerous to their brain development, and called on parents to keep children under two away from television and similar media.
A recent survey by Common Sense Media in the US reveals a paradox, but one that is entirely understandable.
Children in poor American households now not only watch more television than children in affluent households, but are also more likely to have a TV in their room.
When consumption of a commodity falls while income rises, economists speak of an "inferior" commodity.
Of course, the mass media can be useful as providers of information, education, entertainment, and even political awareness.
But too much of it confronts us with dangers that we must avoid.
At the very least, we can minimise these risks.
Successful approaches around the world include restrictions on television advertising, particularly for young children; non-commercial public service broadcasters such as the BBC; and free (but limited) television time for political campaigns.
Of course, the best defence is our own self-control.
We can all turn off the TV for more hours a day and spend that time reading, talking to each other and restoring the foundations of personal health and social trust.
A Neighbourly Option for Iran
JEREVAN - Once again, the question of bombing or sanctioning Iran has arisen.
For years, the debate over Iran has oscillated between two bad alternatives.
Some are convinced that a nuclear Iran is the worst of all possible scenarios, worse even than a pre-emptive strike.
But neither a nuclear-armed Iran nor air strikes against it are smart options, least of all for this region.
The consequences of bombing Iran should be clear: closure of the Strait of Hormuz, soaring oil prices, possible retaliation against Israel (regardless of the origin of the attack), and even greater unrest in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Indeed, the only certainty of a pre-emptive strike is irreparable and long-lasting damage to regional security and political and economic stability.
Of course, the alternative is no safer.
A nuclear-armed Iran would change the security environment of the entire region, and, given the hostility between Israel and Iran, two opposing nuclear powers would be a threat.
The way out of this dilemma is to understand what Iran wants and how to accommodate it without jeopardizing anyone's security.
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said Iran wants to develop uranium enrichment technology for industrial use.
Everyone agrees that Iran has the right to do so.
But the world is divided over whether to believe that Iran is actually doing what it says.
If Iran is disingenuous, as some argue, then once it has reached this first stage of uranium enrichment for industrial purposes, it can easily slide into weapons-grade enrichment and leave the international community out in the cold, with no channels of communication, no observation teams, and no observers willing to sound the alarm.
That is why the world must not focus on the first phase that has already been lost.
Iran has more than 3,000 centrifuges despite international sanctions and threats.
Instead, the world must focus on the second phase, because it is the weapons potential that represents the looming danger, and there are internationally mandated mechanisms for oversight and monitoring.
The Iranians have always said that they will continue to fulfil their obligations and open their doors to observation as members of the non-proliferation community.
But the international community must respect Iran's current industrial goals if it wants Iranian cooperation.
The first step is to make Iran feel besieged.
Fortunately, there are voices in America and elsewhere in favor of engaging Iran at the highest level.
But to talk effectively with Iran, one must understand Iranian values and mindsets.
Iranians have a sense of seniority, if not superiority, born of a rich and ancient culture that has survived into modern times.
But they also have a historically ingrained sense of insecurity, owing to frequent conquests and domination, exacerbated today by the presence of American troops west of them in Iraq and east of them in Afghanistan.
Their view today is the product of these two worldviews - suspicious of other motives and proud of themselves as wise, tough negotiators, and not without their own resources.
In my meetings with the current and former leaders of Syria and Iran, and in my meeting with Saddam Hussein, I heard them all say the same thing: the West is out to get them.
Their explanation was that the West is uncomfortable with the motives and behavior of ideological states - Syria, Iran, and Iraq under Saddam were states with causes such as Islam, Arab unity, or anti-Zionism.
For Iranians, as bearers of faith and national pride, reactions that seem self-righteous and irrational to others are indeed necessary and acceptable.
The fall of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction is a historic example of the willingness to go to hell with their heads held high.
Saddam knew that he did not have weapons of mass destruction, but he was not prepared to grant inspectors the right to ask questions.
As in North Korea, Iran's neighbors could provide the right mechanism to create a more transparent relationship between Iran and the world.
In the so-called six-party talks, North Korea's neighbors offered concrete incentives to Kim Jong Il's regime to abandon its nuclear program.
The most prominent of these was an end to North Korea's economic isolation.
Iran, too, feels besieged, though not isolated: it is heavily dependent on trade, not just as an oil seller.
Two-thirds of the population is under 30, unemployment is high, and the country needs to attract foreign investment for its oil and gas industry and finance road construction and other infrastructure projects.
Comparisons with neighbouring Turkey are instructive.
Before Iran's Islamic revolution, it led Turkey in foreign direct investment, per capita income, and GDP growth.
Now Turkey has made progress and could even join the European Union.
Other regional comparisons reinforce this trend.
The Qataris have overtaken them in exploiting the vast gas field they share.
Tiny Dubai attracts far more foreign investment: Iranians go there for banking, trade, and fun.
Iran's neighbors must convince Iran's leaders that Iranians, too, can participate in the region's growth and even become regional leaders.
Only an open Iran, fully integrated into the regional economy and playing a role commensurate with its size and economic potential, will be able to moderate its siege mentality.
Here, a crucial step would be for the West to begin to consider Iran as a potential alternative gas supplier by offering to connect Iran to the planned White Stream and Nabucco pipelines currently under development to bring Central Asian gas to Europe.
The world's judgments of Iran's motives and actions should not be distorted by Iranian pride.
A new anti-Semitism
These are violent times.
Some believe that we are dealing with a new kind of conflict: "culture wars," such as those between Sunni and Shia Muslims, or tribal groups in Africa and Asia, or even Islamists and Westerners.
But the deeper reasons for some of these conflicts may well be traditional.
Belonging to a particular cultural group is merely a pretext for battles between the winners and losers of globalization.
Unscrupulous leaders mobilize disoriented supporters.
In particular, the losers, often represented by young men with no future, can be led to take even suicidal measures against the supposed enemy.
Perhaps we should not be surprised that at such a time the oldest of our ugly, even deadly resentments, anti-Semitism, is once again emerging from the shadows.
His comeback takes the classic form of attacks on individuals, such as the recent murder of a young Jew in France or the defacing of symbolic sites such as cemeteries and synagogues.
But there is also a general feeling of hostility to everything Jewish.
One might have thought that anti-Semitism died forever with the Holocaust, but it did not.
There are those who deny that the Holocaust ever took place, or that it took place in its all too well documented form.
The deniers range from second-rate historians like David Irving to apparently popular politicians like Iran's recently elected president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
The evidence of what Nazi Germany has done is so strong that those who deny it are likely to be treated without jail, drawing more attention than they deserve.
The more disturbing source of anti-Semitism is another, and justifies talk of a new anti-Semitism.
This has to do with Israel.
Of course, America is the first name for anti-Western sentiment, but its second name is Israel, the only successful modern country in the Middle East that is also highly militarised, an occupying power, and ruthlessly defends its interests.
It is hard to exaggerate the strange mood in the West, which might be called Palestinian romanticism.
Intellectuals like the late Edward Said gave her a voice, but she has many supporters in the United States and Europe.
Palestinian romanticism glorifies Palestinians as victims of Israeli rule, points to the treatment of Israeli Palestinians as second-class citizens at best, and cites the many acts of oppression in the occupied territories, including the impact of Israel's security fence.
People, implicitly or explicitly, side with the victims, contribute by sending them money, even declare suicide bombers legitimate, and move further and further away from supporting and defending Israel.
Of course, it is true that one can theoretically oppose Israel's policy without being anti-Semitic.
After all, there are enough critics of Israeli policy among Israelis.
But the distinction is increasingly difficult to maintain.
Jews outside Israel feel they must defend the land that is, after all, their last hope for security.
This makes their friends hesitate to speak out for fear of being placed not only in an anti-Israeli corner, but also in an anti-Semitic one.
The resistance of Jews and the disturbing silence of their friends means that the stage of public debate is open to those who are actually anti-Semitic, even though they confine themselves to anti-Israeli language.
Anti-Semitism is disgusting, in whatever form.
This also applies to other types of group hatred, but the Holocaust makes anti-Semitism unique because it is a feeling that is complicit in the near-annihilation of an entire people.
However, the new anti-Semitism cannot be successfully combated in the rest of the world only through education and debate.
It is linked to Israel.
If one belongs to a generation that regards Israel as one of the great achievements of the twentieth century, and admires the way in which the country offered a proud homeland to the persecuted and oppressed, one is particularly concerned that it may now be in danger.
A new approach to North Korea
SEOUL - The long-delayed meeting of North Korea's ruling Workers "Party is now taking place at a time of severe tension between North Korea and the international community.
Kim Jong-il's third son, Kim Jong-eun, is widely expected to be appointed to a key position and publicly announced as his father's successor.
There are also indications that there will be a reshuffle of key positions within the party that will allow the presumed heir to form a new power base.
No matter what happens and whoever the new leader becomes, North Korea most likely faces an unstable future.
The cost of maintaining internal order will continue to rise, as the system's fundamental flaws force the new leader to face new challenges.
Moreover, responsibility for dealing with this potential instability extends far beyond Pyongyang's leadership.
North Korea's fragility is hinted at by the fact that even such an important political event as the Workers "Party congress, held for the first time in three decades, was abruptly postponed in early September.
One reason for the delay may be a rift within the ruling elite, a group that "Beloved Leader" Kim Jong Il himself can no longer control as effectively as he used to.
Moreover, Kim's health problems may have worsened much faster than outsiders suspect, complicating matters even more.
"Enough is enough," a senior North Korean official said in a recent private conversation with a South Korean visitor to Pyongyang about Kim Jong Un's likely successor.
Ordinary North Koreans, too, seem to view this succession differently from Kim Jong-il's takeover by his father, Kim Il-sung.
Moreover, with the economy in total decline, as last year's failed attempt at monetary reform demonstrated, there is no hope that any new leader, whoever it may be, will be given breathing space to establish unchallenged control.
The regime is under growing pressure from the grassroots of North Korean society and recognizes its own inability to deal with the situation.
For the first time, North Korea's prime minister publicly apologized for a policy error in the failure of currency reform.
For the dynamics of the relationship between the North Korean people and their rulers appear to be fundamentally changing.
One troubling aspect of this shift is that the new leader may feel the need to resort more often to brute force to quell popular resistance.
And, at a time of domestic distress and diplomatic isolation, North Korea's leaders, whose confidence is strengthened by possession of nuclear weapons, may try to distract their public by brazen and possibly destructive actions abroad.
The attack on the South Korean naval ship Cheonan earlier this year may be a grim sign of what is to come.
Indeed, the North Korean threat today stems more from the regime's internal weaknesses than from its aggressive outward posture, the latter being the authorities "anxious response to the former.
Unfortunately, most international efforts have sought to alleviate the symptoms rather than cure the underlying disease.
To pressure the North Korean government to abandon its nuclear option, current international economic sanctions targeting products and luxury goods related to weapons of mass destruction should probably continue.
But, at the same time, the international community should place greater emphasis on policies aimed at persuading North Korea to undertake serious economic reforms.
At a time of rising tensions between North Korea, South Korea, and the United States, such a policy may seem impossible.
Nevertheless, a roadmap for a peaceful transition can be drawn up.
For example, if North Korea is willing to respect international standards of economic behavior, it could be invited to join the International Monetary Fund.
Western governments could also allow charitable foundations to grant scholarships to North Korean officials or students to study abroad and learn how to run a market economy.
Of course, any aid to North Korea would have to be closely monitored to prevent it from being diverted for military or other political purposes.
The international community would lose nothing if it tried this approach and tested the regime's will to reform.
Indeed, North Korea's leaders may have become more open to economic reform than ever after the recent currency fiasco.
Such an approach is also compatible with China's policy of pressuring North Korea to adopt its model of economic reform.
Of course, the North Korean regime is not the only obstacle to international engagement.
Conservatives in both the United States and South Korea may argue that North Korea must move toward denuclearization before offering any kind of economic assistance.
But there is no reason why international efforts to denuclearize North Korea must exclude policies aimed at domestic reform.
We must not assume that these objectives cannot be pursued simultaneously.
On the contrary, without far-reaching domestic policy changes, it may be impossible to win North Korea's approval for denuclearization.
The last two decades have shown that even in the long run, "politically correct" decisions do not produce the right results.
While North Korea cultivates a new leader, the world must cultivate a new policy for North Korea.
A New Agreement for UN Reform
The United Nations is torn apart by internal tensions.
No sooner has the controversy over the creation of a Human Rights Council been satisfactorily resolved than a new battle has broken out.
The United States is pushing for administrative reforms and threatening to cut off funding if the reforms do not come.
The Secretary-General has put forward a sensible reform plan, but a majority of UN member states, acting collectively as the so-called G-77, balk at it, seeing it as another step toward curtailing the General Assembly's authority over the Security Council.
In particular, they object to the proposal < br > by the Secretary-General, whose de facto selection is in the hands of the Security Council's five permanent members, who wield veto power, to transfer expanded powers and responsibilities.
Many UN members believe that power within the UN has shifted from the General Assembly, and are reluctant to give up what they see as their last vestige: control over the budget through the work of the General Assembly's Fifth Committee.
In practice, the Fifth Committee has exercised the kind of micro-management of staff and expenditure that the Secretary-General should exercise if the UN is to operate effectively and have a staff that is up to the challenges facing the organisation.
This is the basis of America's insistence on administrative reform.
We urgently need to find a way out of this impasse.
Failure of the current proposal would effectively put an end to all efforts to reform the United Nations, with disastrous consequences for people around the world who depend on aid from the United Nations Development Program, security through the United Nations "many peacekeeping operations, or the myriad other services provided by UN agencies.
For example, a failure to reform the administration would fuel calls by the US Congress to withhold America's contributions to the UN budget - a policy that would severely undermine America's own interests, such as the planned expansion of the mission to end the genocide in Darfur.
The path to a satisfactory resolution is clear: Give the General Assembly a greater role in selecting the Secretary-General, so that members would delegate powers to an authority of their choice.
This solution would not only allow the implementation of much-needed administrative reforms, but would also bring clarity and transparency to a process that urgently needs improvement.
Finally, the UN Charter stipulates that "the Secretary-General shall be appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council." The original plan was for the two bodies to agree on a candidate.
In practice, however, the five permanent members now agree on a candidate, and their decision is approved first by the Security Council and then by the General Assembly.
Genuine discussions about a new Secretary-General are currently taking place behind closed doors among the permanent five, adding to the frustration of other UN members, including the major powers that have tried unsuccessfully to enlarge the Security Council.
In order to achieve the desired reforms of the budgetary process, the US must persuade the other permanent members of the Council to give the General Assembly a greater role in this process.
This could be done in several ways.
The Security Council could agree to recommend several candidates from which the General Assembly would select one.
Alternatively, the General Assembly could propose several candidates to the Security Council from which the Council would select one to be referred back to the Assembly for approval.
Either way, the selection process would benefit from greater transparency.
For example, the General Assembly should hold public hearings to interview candidates, greatly improving the stature of the candidate who is ultimately selected.
Such proposals, if adopted, would help to resolve the current dispute to the satisfaction of all.
In fact, they could make the UN stronger than it ever was.
A new opportunity for Darfur
NEW BRUNSWICK, NEW JERSEY - As the crisis in Sudan's Darfur region deepens and negotiations to end it drag on, an international consensus is emerging on policies based on public denunciation, tough economic sanctions, and growing threats of military force.
But none of these steps, alone or together, can achieve the goals that their often well-meaning advocates seek.
On the contrary, they risk repeating the chaos that such actions have caused in Iraq and elsewhere in recent years.
In the United States, even staunchly liberal newspapers like the New York Times have been remarkably absent from warning voices.
Democratic Party foreign policy advisers and neoconservatives alike have called for "action" against Sudan - demands echoed by an international group of intellectuals and celebrities from Umberto Eco, Juergen Habermas, and Harold Pinter to Bob Geldof, George Clooney, Mia Farrow, Matt Damon, Mick Jagger, and J.K. Rowling.
Meanwhile, French troops, with the support of other EU members - notably Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Poland, Romania, and Sweden - are stationed in the Central African Republic and Chad, where they have already clashed with Sudanese government forces, on supposedly humanitarian grounds.
The International Crisis Group, Human Rights Watch, and many other organizations support this effort, while Save Darfur, while describing itself as an apolitical alliance of more than 180 religious, lobbying, and humanitarian organizations, has actually played a central role in setting the political agenda.
Gradual interventionism is on the agenda: tougher economic sanctions, demands on China to use its influence, the establishment of a no-fly zone, and military force against the Sudanese army.
It is believed that only real pressure will ultimately force the Sudanese government to join the United Nations and African Union peacekeeping force, negotiate with the West, disband the feared Janjaweed militia, allow refugees from the country's brutal civil war to return to their villages, and make peace with the rebels in the south.
However, in order to achieve these objectives, the government in Khartoum needs to cooperate, whereas any of the proposed measures would only increase tensions or prove useless.
Existing Western sanctions, for example, have only driven the Sudanese regime into the arms of China, Indonesia, and Malaysia.
Indeed, investment in Sudan increased by $2.8 billion last year.
Efforts to put pressure on the Chinese appear similarly futile.
Darfur is not a high priority for China, which handles 20% of Africa's trade and buys 60% of Sudan's oil.
The growing talk in both Europe and America about boycotting the Olympics (or the opening ceremony) has proved to be wholly ineffective in influencing China's behavior in Tibet.
Would the threat of a boycott of Darfur really prove more successful?
Advocates of a no-fly zone also doubt its potential effectiveness.
After all, Sudan is the size of Western Europe, and Darfur is the size of France, with 158 refugee camps.
Strategic constraints would almost certainly overwhelm enforcement.
Finally, there is the "military option," which would only justify fears of Western imperialism in Sudan.
Worse, given the fragmentation of rebel forces in the south, where an estimated 80 tribes and clans control their own militias, a military response could create a power vacuum in Sudan, destabilizing the nine countries, many of which are fragile or failed states on its borders.
Western analysts and activists should have learned by now that military threats only provoke resistance, and that true diplomacy involves not only carrots, but also sticks.
But the emerging political consensus contains no positive incentives for resolving the Darfur crisis.
Nor is it clear whether its aim is to put pressure on Sudan to change its policies or to bring about wholesale regime change.
I have been to Sudan twice and visited the refugee camps in Nyala and El Fasher in Darfur as part of a delegation organised by Conscience International.
I have met dozens of Sudanese politicians and diplomats and know that the regime in Khartoum is authoritarian, selfish and ruthless.
But it is not monolithic.
Groups within the regime may prove supporters of new policies aimed at alleviating Sudan's climate of violence, reducing its trade dependence on China, improving conditions for refugees, and reducing international tensions.
Such measures could include:
The emerging political consensus on Sudan is based on an approach that has already undermined respect for Western values throughout the non-Western world.
His interventionist measures have not worked.
They are unrealistic and ultimately counterproductive.
There is no time to lose trying something new.
A new dawn for Chinese journalism?
One notable incident has emboldened Chinese journalists.
Earlier this year, the government suspended publication of Bing Dian Weekly, provoking unprecedented open protests that have been widely reported worldwide.
Even more surprising is that the government, under pressure from public opinion, has allowed Bing Dian to resume publication.
The editor-in-chief and deputy editor-in-chief have been dismissed, but overt questioning of the legitimacy of the state's authority to regulate journalism is bound to have profound repercussions.
Foreign observers tend to associate the Bing Dian incident with other recent crackdowns on China's mass media, concluding that the freedom of Chinese journalism is hopeless under current autocratic regulation.
Since China introduced its "open door" policy nearly 30 years ago, there has undeniably been no major change in the state's system of journalism regulation.
Will gold rise to $10,000?
SAN FRANCISCO <unk> It's never been easy to have a rational conversation about the value of gold.
Recently, however, this has become more difficult than ever, with the price of gold rising by more than 300% over the past decade.
Only last December, my colleagues Martin Feldstein and Nouriel Roubini made comments boldly questioning the prevailing optimistic market sentiment and pointing out the risks of gold in a very deliberate way.
And it came as it had to.
Since the publication of their articles, the price of gold has risen even further.
It recently hit a record high of $1,300.
Last December, the Goldbugs argued that the price would undoubtedly go toward $2,000.
Buoyed by the continuing upward trend, some believe gold could rise even higher.
A successful gold investor recently told me that stock prices had been floundering for more than a decade before the Dow Jones index surpassed 1,000 points in the early 1980 "s.
Since then it has risen to more than 10,000 points.
Now that gold has passed the magic barrier of $1,000, why not multiply its value tenfold?
Granted, it doesn't take much imagination to imagine an even higher gold price.
After all, adjusted for inflation, today's gold price is nowhere near the all-time high of January 1980.
Back then, gold was $850, well over $2,000 in today's money.
But there was apparently a freak peak in January 1980 at a time of heightened geopolitical instability.
At $1,300, today's price is probably double the very long-term average gold price, adjusted for inflation.
So what could justify another colossal rise in the price of gold from this value?
One possibility, of course, is the total collapse of the US dollar.
With ballooning deficits and a directionless fiscal policy, one wonders whether a populist administration would not recklessly turn on the money-printing machine.
And if you are really worried about this, gold may actually be the most reliable hedge.
Of course, it can be argued that inflation-indexed bonds are a better and more direct hedge than gold.
But the Goldbugs are right to worry about whether the government appreciated such engagement in more extreme circumstances.
As Carmen Reinhart and I show in our recent book on the history of financial crises, This Time is Different, default governments often forcibly convert these indexed bonds into non-indexed bonds so that their value inflates away.
Even in the United States, index clauses were removed from bond contracts during the Great Depression of the 1930 "s.
So this can happen anywhere, but even if very high inflation is possible, it does not mean that it is likely.
One should therefore be wary of arguing that higher gold prices are driven by inflation expectations.
Some also say that gold's long upward trend is partly due to the development of new financial instruments that facilitate trading and speculation in gold.
There may be a grain of truth and a degree of irony in that.
The medieval alchemists were already engaged in the absurd search for a way to make gold out of base metals.
Wouldn't it be paradoxical if financial alchemy could dramatically increase the value of a bullion?
In my view, the strongest reason for today's high gold price is the dramatic rise of Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East into the global economy.
Legions of new consumers are gaining purchasing power, which inevitably increases demand, raising the price of scarce goods.
At the same time, emerging-market central banks must build up gold reserves, which they still hold to a much smaller extent than rich-country central banks.
With the euro looking uninviting as a way to diversify the dollar portfolio, gold's appeal is naturally increasing.
So, yes, some fundamentals do underpin today's gold prices, though it is questionable whether and to what extent they will underpin higher prices in the future.
Another crucial and fundamental factor that contributed to high gold prices may prove far more short-lived than globalization.
The price of gold is extremely sensitive to global changes in interest rates.
After all, gold brings no interest, and storage actually costs something.
With interest rates in many countries at record lows, it is relatively cheap to speculate on gold instead of investing in bonds.
But if real interest rates rise significantly, as may one day be the case, the gold price could plummet.
Most economic research shows that forecasting the price of gold in the short to medium term is very difficult, with the chances of profit and loss roughly evaporating.
Therefore, it is dangerous to derive forecasts from short-term trends.
Yes, gold did well, but so did global real estate prices until a few years ago.
If you are a high net worth investor, sovereign wealth fund, or central bank, it makes perfect sense to hold a modest portion of your portfolio in gold as a hedge against extreme events.
But, despite its increased appeal in the wake of an extraordinary price rise, gold remains a very risky proposition for most of us.
Is Iraq the Next Afghanistan?
At the start of the US-led Iraq war, two competing predictions emerged about its outcome.
The first claimed that the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime was likely to usher in an era of democracy in Iraq, which would serve as a model and catalyst for the region's democratic transformation.
Mocked by critics as a new "domino theory," this view portrayed intervention in Iraq as something akin to America's role in Japan after World War II.
Against the optimism of this "Japan scenario," the pessimists claimed that a "Somalia scenario" was more likely.
They based their claim on Iraq's tribal, sectarian, and multi-ethnic nature, which, without a dictatorship, would likely lead Iraq to collapse into a "failed state," with rampant warlords, ethnic and religious feuds, and harbors for terrorist organizations.
But the main question now is whether Iraq will drift anywhere between these two scenarios to become increasingly like Afghanistan.
This "Afghan scenario" involves a weak state with nominal power over truly autonomous tribes led by strongmen as their representatives in the state government.
Bad as it may sound, this perspective seems to be a "realistic" compromise between the presumably utopian vision of a prosperous, unified democracy and the misery of a failed state.
Many of the actions and policies of the Provisional Coalition Authority (CPA), as well as higher-level decisions by the Bush administration, seem to indicate a resigned acceptance, and that the earlier hope that Iraq would embrace Western-style democracy has been lost.
Indeed, such hopes have been lost.
Iraq's political culture - and that of most of the Middle East - is incompatible with the basic elements of a recognisable Western-style democracy: notions of individual rights and responsibility are absent, the notion of a patriarchal state is deeply rooted, and individual cultural identity is rarely committed to the national community.
On the other hand, many fallacies characterize analyses that consider the "traditional" nature of Iraqi society to be an obstacle to liberal democracy.
For these analyses are hardly neutral, but inadvertently enter into an ongoing dispute.
In Iraq, as elsewhere in the Arab and Muslim world, a cultural war is being waged between two models: here grand designs that tolerate a collectivist understanding (nationalism, socialism, Islamism), and there a subliminal paradigm of individualist modernity that is locally rooted but sustained by global experience.
The front lines in this war are concepts of individual and cultural identity, civil society and the nation state.
The religious Islamic component of Iraqi social life should not be underestimated.
But it should not be put on an equal footing with political Islamism, which is trying to capitalize on it.
Nationalist and socialist political discourses have left their mark on the Iraqi value system, but they are not its only constituent parts.
Indeed, the nominal acceptance of the grand blueprint of "democracy" and "human rights" as a common basis for political discourse represents a major shift in the delineation of the front in the cultural struggle.
The cultural debate is not limited to the Arab scene.
There is also lively discussion in the West about the applicability of democratic institutions in the Arab context.
Advocates of the notion of an "Arab exceptionalism," who question Arab societies "ability to adapt to democratic systems, are indeed objectively allied with the ideologues of the" grand designs "- and also with the beneficiaries of the Arab world's protectionist political order.
The patterns used in the West by both political and academic circles to analyse and interpret Arab societies are seriously inadequate.
In particular, many analyses today extol an ethnic model, reducing Iraq to an artificial entity imposed on a fragmented "reality" of divided communities.
Some have even suggested accelerating the outcome predicted by these misguided views by dividing Iraq into its original "real" constituents: Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds.
Indeed, Iraqi society is more complex than that.
The acceptance and adoption of democracy is not a function of sectarianism, but a reflection on the multidimensional, historical, cultural, religious and political identities of Iraqi individuals.
Under the right circumstances, it is perfectly possible to move Iraqi society towards the democratic shaping of its future state.
The fall of Saddam initiates such right circumstances.
Indeed, the apparent failure to establish a discernible democratic core in Iraq in the first few months after the collapse of Saddam's dictatorship is due more to the peculiarities of the process than to the supposed nature of Iraqi society.
Until Saddam's fall, there was a broad "middle class" in Iraq that was favorable to democratic discourses and procedures.
Political mistakes and upheavals have crushed this middle class, opening the way to ideological Islamism and a resurgent neo-Ba'athism.
The main flaw was the failure of the occupying forces to equip and empower the small group of Iraqi liberal democrats to penetrate that middle class, with the result that the margin for a liberal democratic outcome shrank.
But to regard this setback as a failure would be a self-affirming prophecy.
Iraq's democrats need to rediscover and develop a clear public relations strategy.
The CPA and the world community should not prejudice the outcome of their efforts by adopting a superficial and misguided view of Iraqi society.
Even if such efforts are successful, the road to a proper democratic system in Iraq will still be arduous and costly.
But, instead of succumbing to a "Somalia scenario," or dreaming of a "Japan scenario," or becoming comfortable with an "Afghanistan scenario," Iraq could still become a "scenario" for successful intervention in the twenty-first century.
A neo-Ottoman Turkey?
ANKARA: Today, the international media is obsessed with the question of who lost Turkey and what this supposed loss means for Europe and the West.
More alarmingly, some commentators equate Turkey's neighbourhood policy with a resurgence of Ottoman imperialism.
Recently, a leading Turkish columnist went so far as to quote Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu as saying that "we are indeed neo-Ottoman."
As someone who was there when Davutoğlu gave his speech to the parliamentary group of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), I can testify that he did not use those words.
In fact, neither Davutoğlu nor any of us in the AKP's foreign policy community use this term, because it is simply a distortion of our position.
Turkey's Neighbourhood Policy is designed to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhoods: the Balkans, the Black Sea region, the Caucasus, the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean.
Our aim is to deepen our political dialogue, increase our trade and increase people-to-people contacts with our neighbours in the form of sport, tourism and cultural activities.
When Egon Bahr formulated his Ostpolitik in the 1960s, no one asked Will Brandt if Germany had been lost.
God has given Turkey a geographical position that makes it a fundamental requirement that we commit ourselves to the East and the West, the North and the South.
We don't have a choice, it's not a luxury, it's a necessity.
The symbol of the Byzantine and Seljuk empires, which covered roughly the same area as Turkey today, was a double-headed eagle looking east and west.
It should come as no surprise to anyone that Turkey, too, is moving toward both ends of its territory, and that it believes that its security can best be consolidated by minimizing risks with its neighbors.
In this respect, we consider the current debate on Turkey's orientation to be rather superfluous and, in some cases, malicious.
Our neighbourhood policy needs support, not criticism.
Turkey has become a priceless asset in the fabric of the regions around us and is already changing the status quo towards greater stability and predictability.
Our efforts to normalize relations with Armenia, for example, are designed to bring about change throughout the South Caucasus.
We are playing our part in shouldering the burden.
Sensible Europeans understand that.
To be sure, some of our neighbors are difficult.
But no country has the luxury of choosing its neighbors.
Turkey's neighbourhood policy is very realistic and is based on genuine interests, not romantic neo-Ottoman glorification, as more than a few international commentators suggest.
There is certainly a neo-Ottoman revival in the cultural sphere, and our citizens are interested in rediscovering the life, culture and practices of the Ottomans.
Turkey is normalizing itself domestically and reinterpreting its understanding of national history.
This is a natural by-product of the consolidation of our democracy.
However, the attempt to add an imperialist touch to our carefully conceived foreign policy initiatives is not only a complete distortion of the facts, but also a gross injustice to our well-intentioned efforts to stabilise our region.
In Roman mythology, Janus was the god of doors and gates, the god of beginning and end.
Today's Turkey, with its Janus-like geography, opens doors and gates to the East and West.
It offers the Caucasus, the Black Sea, the Balkans and the Mediterranean opportunities for a fresh start and also for bringing things to a close.
In this capacity, Turkey complements and supports a unique transition between otherwise difficult regions, for it represents centuries of coexistence and adaptation.
Turkish foreign policy contributes to this convergence and helps its immediate neighbourhoods to establish contact with each other.
Contrary to recent claims, Turkey's foreign policy makers do not seek a revival of the Ottoman Empire.
Instead, we are seeking Turkey's historic reintegration into its immediate neighborhoods, correcting a Cold War-era anomaly.
Such reintegration would only benefit the European Union and our other Western NATO allies.
None of them therefore has any reason to express unease about Turkey.
1929 or 1989?
PARIS As the economic crisis deepens and widens, the world is looking for historical analogies to help us understand what happened.
At the start of the crisis, many compared it to 1982 or 1973, which was reassuring, because both data refer to classic cyclical downturns.
Today, the mood is much bleaker, and references to 1929 and 1931 are beginning to emerge, even if some governments continue to behave as if the crisis were classic rather than exceptional.
The tendency is either excessive restraint (Europe) or dispersion of effort (the United States).
Europe is reticent to avoid debt and protect the euro, while the US has taken action on many fronts so as not to miss the ideal opportunity to implement much-needed structural reforms.
Geostrategists, on the other hand, naturally think of 1989, both politically and economically.
The decline of the investment bank Lehman Brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the Berlin Wall, of course.
On the surface, it even seems to be its perfect antithesis: the collapse of a wall that symbolizes oppression and artificial divisions, compared with the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and reassuring institution of financial capitalism.
Nevertheless, the years 2008-2009, similar to 1989, may well correspond to an epochal change, the obvious consequences of which will be felt for decades.
The end of the ideological division between East and West and the end of absolute trust in the markets are historic turning points.
And what will happen in 2009 could jeopardize some of the positive results of 1989, including the peaceful reunification of Europe and the victory of democratic principles over nationalist, if not xenophobic, tendencies.
In 1989, liberal democracy triumphed over the socialist ideology embodied and promoted by the Eastern Bloc.
For many of his supporters, it was President Ronald Reagan who, with his deliberate escalation of the arms race, pushed the Soviet economy to its limits, providing full proof of the superiority of liberal societies and free markets.
Of course, there are significant differences between 1989 and today.
First, and perhaps most importantly, the revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union put an end to global bipolarity.
By contrast, 2009 is likely to pave the way for a new form of bipolarity, with China taking the place of the Soviet Union.
Second, while democracy and market capitalism seemed clear winners in 1989, albeit weaker than expected, it is difficult to distinguish winners from losers in 2009, given the extent of the global crisis.
Everyone seems to be a loser, even if some are more affected than others.
But history is unfair, and the US, despite its greater responsibility for the current global crisis, may emerge from the morass in better shape than most countries.
In better shape, but not alone.
As a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT, I get a good idea of what the world might look like when the crisis finally ends.
One senses something like the emergence of an American-Asian dominated universe.
Asians, especially Chinese and Indians, are everywhere, from the incredible Media Lab at MIT to the faculties of mathematics and economics at Harvard, like the Romans in Athens in the first century BC: full of admiration for those from whom they have learned so much, and who they will leave behind in the decades to come.
But before this new order emerges, the world could face an expanding disorder, if not total chaos.
For example, what will happen to a country as central and vulnerable as Egypt if hundreds of thousands of Egyptians working in the Gulf are forced to return home as a result of the crisis in the oil-producing countries?
When the rich get less rich, the poor get poorer.
And what about the foreign workers who have grasped the European dream and are now facing potential outbreaks of xenophobia in Europe's supposedly open countries?
The consequences of 1989 were ultimately less lasting than many observers, myself included, had assumed.
We can only hope that the consequences of 2009 will turn out to be far less dramatic than they feel today, intuitively and through our historical reflexes.
The end of 1945
NEW YORK - When World War II officially ended in Europe on May 8, 1945, much of the world lay in ruins.
But even if man's capacity for destruction knows no bounds, his talent for a new beginning is equally remarkable.
Perhaps this is why humanity has been able to survive so far.
There is no doubt that millions of people were too hungry and exhausted at the end of the war to do much beyond bare survival.
Yet at the same time, a wave of idealism rolled through the ruins, a collective sense of determination to build a more just, peaceful, and secure world.
That is why the great hero of the war, Winston Churchill, was voted out of office as Prime Minister in the summer of 1945, even before Japan surrendered.
Men and women had not risked their lives only to return to the old days of class privileges and social disadvantage.
They wanted better housing, education and free healthcare for all.
Similar demands have been made throughout Europe, where anti-fascist or anti-fascist resistance has often been led by leftists or communists, and pre-war conservatives have often been burdened by their collaboration with fascist regimes.
In countries such as France, Italy and Greece there was talk of revolution.
These did not take place, however, because they were neither supported by the Western Allies nor by the Soviet Union.
Stalin was content to create an empire in Eastern Europe.
But even Charles de Gaulle, a leader of right-wing resistance, had to accept communists in his first post-war government, and he agreed to nationalize industries and banks.
The swing to the left towards social democratic welfare states took place throughout Western Europe.
It was part of the 1945 consensus.
A different kind of revolution occurred in the former European colonies in Asia, where indigenous populations did not want to be governed again by Western powers that had been so humiliatingly defeated by Japan.
Vietnamese, Indonesians, Filipinos, Burmese, Indians and Malaysians also wanted their freedom.
These aspirations were often expressed in the United Nations, founded in 1945.
The UN, like the dream of European unity, was part of the 1945 consensus.
For a short time, many prominent figures, such as Albert Einstein, believed that only a world government would be able to ensure global peace.
That dream quickly crumbled when the Cold War divided the world into two hostile blocs.
But, in some ways, Cold War politics strengthened the 1945 consensus - in the West.
Communism, still shrouded in the laurels of anti-fascism, had far-reaching intellectual and emotional appeal, not only in the so-called Third World, but also in Western Europe.
Social democracy, with its promise of greater equality and opportunity for all, served as an ideological antidote.
Indeed, most social democrats were fierce opponents of communism.
Today, 70 years later, much of the 1945 consensus has survived.
Few people manage to muster much enthusiasm for the UN.
The European dream is in crisis.
And the post-war social democratic welfare state is being increasingly eroded by the day.
That decline began in the 1980 "s under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.
The neo-liberals took aim at the cost of social programs and the special interests of trade unions. Citizens, it was said, had to act more self-responsibly.
State social programs would make them sluggish and dependent.
As Thatcher famously put it, there was no such thing as a "society," only families and individuals who were to take care of themselves.
But the 1945 consensus was dealt an even bigger blow when we all celebrated the collapse of the Soviet empire, the other great tyranny of the twentieth century.
In 1989, it seemed that the dark legacy of World War II, namely the enslavement of Eastern Europe, had finally come to an end.
And in many ways it was.
But there was something else that broke with the Soviet model.
Social democracy lost its raison d "être as an antidote to communism.
All kinds of leftist ideology, and indeed anything that smacked of collective idealism, were seen as misguided utopianism that could only lead to the gulag.
Neoliberalism filled this vacuum.
It brought enormous wealth to some people, but at the expense of the post-World War II ideal of equality.
The extraordinary resonance of Thomas Piketty's book Capital in the 21st Century shows how intensely the consequences of the collapse of the Left were felt.
In recent years, other ideologies have developed to meet the human need for collective ideals.
The rise of right-wing populism reflects a renewed desire for purely national communities that exclude immigrants and minorities.
And American neoconservatives have perversely transformed the internationalism of the old left by using US military force to try to establish a democratic world order.
The answer to these alarming developments is not nostalgia.
We cannot simply go back to the past.
Too much has changed for that.
A hundred years of incompetence
BERLIN The global financial and economic crisis that began in 2008 was the biggest economic stress test since the Great Depression and the biggest challenge to social and political systems since World War II.
It not only put financial markets and currencies at risk, but also exposed serious regulatory and governance deficiencies that have still not been fully addressed.
Indeed, the 2008 crisis is likely to be remembered as a turning point, but not because it led to reforms that strengthened economic resilience and eliminated weaknesses.
On the contrary, governments "failure to learn, let alone follow, the lessons of the Great Recession could pave the way for a series of new economic and other crises in the coming decades.
No matter how serious these crises prove to be, historians will probably despair of our myopia in a hundred years.
You will find that analysts and regulators focused closely on repairing the financial system by strengthening national supervisory systems.
And they will point out that, while this was a worthy goal, it was far from the only necessity.
Equipping the world to meet the challenges posed by globalization and technological development in a way that supports sustainable and equitable growth will require drastic improvements in regulatory institutions and rules at both national and international levels.
But there has not been nearly enough investment in this venture.
Apart from regional institutions such as the European Union, little has changed in the governance of the international financial system.
Worse, because partial corrections to the financial system will allow for even greater globalization, they will ultimately make matters worse, as the burdens of the already inadequate governance and regulatory framework increase not only in the financial sector, but also in other economic and technology sectors.
At the same time, the huge financial investment aimed at achieving higher returns is likely to fuel technological innovation, thereby placing further burdens on regulatory systems in the financial sector and beyond.
Significant technological advances fueled by cheap money can lead to such rapid changes in markets that political and institutional change does not follow.
And new markets can emerge that offer huge returns to early users or investors who benefit from being several steps ahead of national and international regulators.
This is precisely what happened in the run-up to the 2008 crisis.
New financial instruments made possible by technology have provided an opportunity for some to earn enormous sums.
But regulators were unable to keep pace with the changes, which ultimately created risks that affected the entire economy.
This points to a fundamental difference between the global crises of the twenty-first century and, say, the Great Depression of the 1930s, or indeed all past stock-market crises.
Due to the growth of the financial sector, more actors benefit in the short term from inadequate regulation and weak governance, making it difficult to prevent today's crises.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that the systems affected by today's crises go well beyond the competence of individual regulators.
This makes crises far more difficult to manage and their consequences, including their long-term impact on society and politics, harder to predict.
The coming crises, made more likely by rising nationalism and disdain for science and fact-based policy decisions, could be financial in nature, but they could also include areas as diverse as migration, trade, cyberspace, pollution, and climate change.
In all of these areas, national and international governance institutions are weak or incomplete, and there are few independent actors, such as watchdog groups, demanding transparency and accountability.
This makes it difficult not only to prevent crises, not least because it creates opportunities for actors to manipulate the system and shift responsibility, but also to respond to them.
The 2008 crisis highlights how poorly we are able to respond quickly to disasters, particularly those fuelled by fragmentation of governance.
Of course, improvements have been made in preparing for and managing crises, as the Hertie School's 2018 Governance Report shows.
But we need to be more vigilant about developments beyond the control of national and international institutions in a wide range of areas, from the financial sector to digital technologies to climate change.
We should play through crisis scenarios and contingency planning for turbulence in all of these areas, and take stronger steps to mitigate risks, including managing debt levels that are much higher in advanced economies today than they were before the 2008 crisis.
We should also ensure that we equip the international institutions with the necessary resources and competences.
And by punishing those who aggravate risks out of self-interest, we would strengthen the legitimacy of global governance and the institutions that are supposed to implement it.
A major obstacle to crisis prevention and management is currently insufficient cross-border coordination and enforcement of international agreements.
But, instead of addressing this weakness, the world is once again falling back on an outdated model of national sovereignty that makes crises of various kinds more likely.
Unless we change course soon, the world of 2118 will have every reason to look down on us with contempt.
2011: My personal space odyssey
MOSCOW Most people who know me think of me as an information technology expert who probably lives in California and invests in trendy Internet start-ups.
In fact, I have my main residence in New York, and soon I will be going to Russia for five months to train as a cosmonaut in Star City, near Moscow.
Various ways led me there.
As a child, I thought I would one day fly to the moon without much effort on my part.
It was clear to me that once I was in my 40s, travelling into space would be a given.
My father worked on the US space program and at home we had a few stones from the moon, so I thought that such a trip to space could not be a big deal.
Afterwards, I was employed for about 40 years.
A few years ago, however, space travel returned to the center of my attention.
Many acquaintances from the IT sector did the same: Elon Musk, co-founder of PayPal, founded the company Space-X;
Amazon's Jeff Bezos set up a space company called Blue Origin;
Jeff Greason, senior executive at Intel, founded XCOR Aerospace (in which I am a shareholder).
And in 2005, when I last held my <unk> PC Forum for IT entrepreneurs, I initiated another conference called <unk> Flight School <unk> for entrepreneurs in the aerospace and private aviation industries.
That same year, I was in South Africa with a small team to advise President Thabo Mbeki and his government on IT policy.
One member of that team was Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Thawte (which was later sold to VeriSign), who had just returned from a trip to space in which he was the second space tourist to take part.
One evening, at sunset, we were sitting around a campfire when 50 South African schoolchildren arrived on buses.
Together with President Mbeki, the group consisted of about 100 people gathered around the blazing fire.
After dark, a screen was set up and Mark showed us videos from space.
He told us fascinating stories of his adventures, accompanied by pictures of him floating in weightlessness, trying to catch drops with his mouth, and so on.
The kids had a lot of fun and I'm sure some of them decided to study mathematics and science straight away.
Eventually, I joined the company Space Adventures, which had organised Shuttleworth's trip to space.
Later, I took part in a tour offered by this company to the Baikonur spaceport in Kazakhstan to follow the launch of Charles Simonyi, the fifth (and seventh) space tourist.
(Simonyi developed the Microsoft Word program and now owns his own start-up called Intentional Software as well as a foundation and runs the website CharlesinSpace.org.)
Soon after, I started talking casually about the possibility of becoming a backup cosmonaut on the Space Adventures team.
Yes, I would love to go to space, but it costs between $35 million and $40 million, whereas the cost of training a replacement spacewalker is only $3 million.
I had the vague idea that I might go into space in 2011, the year Google co-founder Sergey Brin is likely to start his journey.
Space Adventures pushed for an appointment in 2009, but I was too busy.
Then, last spring, it happened: my sister Emily fell ill with cancer and had to undergo a double mastectomy.
(In the meantime she is doing well again and she has just won a mini-marathon).
A few weeks later, I had one of those typical scheduling conflicts: a board meeting here, a conference there and an appointment elsewhere, and I thought if I only had a double mastectomy, I could cancel all those appointments and no one would complain!
I realised that my priorities had got out of hand, and strangely enough, this sabbatical in Russia is my alternative to double mastectomy - a positive alternative, of course, but a kind of reboot.
This is also the answer to another question I am confronted with due to my work in the field of human genetics at 23andMe (www.23andme.com) and Personal Genome Project (www.personalgenome.org): What would you do if you learned that you were likely to develop Alzheimer's disease in a few years? Of course I would be trained as a cosmonaut!
So why wait until you find out that you might get Alzheimer's? Next month I will tell you all about training for a space flight.
A comeback strategy for Europe
STOCKHOLM / MADRID - When Pope Francis addressed the European Parliament in November, he compared the European Union to a grandmother with experience, but without the vitality and energy of yesteryear.
It is high time, he said, that EU leaders shed their sleepy image, address Europe's strategic problems and find clear measures to solve them.
In some respects, of course, the Pope's assessment is justified.
But, despite obvious fatigue, Europe continues to have significant strengths.
The continent is a hub of high-quality ideas and innovation, home to some of the world's most competitive regions and industries, but perhaps most impressive of all is the creation of a community and a market that encompasses half a billion people.
But the world is changing: the Asia-Pacific region is becoming more and more influential in global economic and other developments.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a supra-regional free-trade area created by the US and 11 other countries, is likely to accelerate that transition (all the more so if China joins).
While the TPP has yet to overcome much resistance before it can be agreed, its potential to strengthen the Asian economy cannot be underestimated.
Europe must seek to assert its position in this new world order, first by improving its own trade and investment relations with the US.
The problem is that, as the TPP negotiations progress, talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) have become so mired in national controversy that the entire project could be overturned.
Business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic are convinced that a successful TTIP deal would bring significant economic benefits, a view backed up by many studies.
And yet the debate continues to be dominated by trivial issues such as the use of chlorinated chicken or resolving investor disputes.
The goal of TTIP is to unleash the power of the transatlantic economy, which is still by far the largest and richest market in the world, accounting for three-quarters of global financial activity and more than half of world trade.
(If TTIP were opened to other economies such as Mexico, Canada or Turkey, the benefits would be even greater.)
Even more obvious than the benefits of the agreement, however, would be the catastrophic consequences of possible failure.
Breaking up TTIP talks would give a massive boost to those in the UK who want to leave the EU, while introducing TTIP would be unwise for the country and therefore unlikely to lead to leaving the EU.
Moreover, the perception that the EU has missed a strategic opportunity because of internal differences would accelerate the US's shift away from Europe.
And Russian President Vladimir Putin sees such a failure as a great opportunity to increase his influence over parts of Europe.
All of this contributes to a fundamental strategic risk: if TTIP fails or reaches an impasse while TPP succeeds, the global balance would tilt sharply toward Asia, and Europe would have little, if any, chance of regaining its economic and geopolitical clout.
When TTIP was proposed, Europe seemed to recognize the value of the agreement.
Indeed, the US initially had doubts about Europeans "commitment, and it was the EU that pushed the negotiating process forward in June 2013.
The aim was to get the negotiations behind us with a tank of fuel.
No one wanted long talks or the political pain that comes with them.
But EU leaders have more or less abandoned the project, confirming American concerns.
Negotiators sought to make progress, but at the same time, the public debate has been taken over by anti-globalization groups who see TTIP as a threat to all European values, from democracy to health.
This is dangerously wrong, and European policymakers must prevent this criticism from growing by clearly positioning the project strategically.
And they must renew their commitment to conclude the negotiations successfully in 2015.
This does not mean that resolving the remaining problems in the TTIP negotiations will be easy.
But establishing a trade agreement with so much regulatory detail is always difficult, because it must take into account the complexity and variability of modern economies.
The fact is that the challenges of completing TTIP are no greater than those faced by EU leaders in the last few years of the crisis.
When TTIP negotiations resume next month, Europe's leaders must push for real progress so that a decision can be taken by the end of the year.
The good news is that their chances could be enhanced by the current midterm elections in the US.
President Barack Obama could now get so-called fast-track negotiating authorization from Congress.
Then, instead of tearing apart the details, Congress could simply accept or reject any negotiated agreement.
As the US election season begins, the EU agenda could easily be hijacked by other issues in the new year.
European leaders must therefore waste no time.
They need to seize the economic opportunity and avoid a strategic catastrophe.
Another slow year for the global economy
WASHINGTON, DC - Last April, the International Monetary Fund forecast that the global economy would grow by 3.5% in 2015.
In the following months this forecast was lowered further and reached 3.1% in October.
But the IMF continues to claim with near-mundane predictability that next year will be better than the last seven years.
And he will almost certainly be wrong again.
For starters, world trade is growing at a meager 2% per year, compared to 8% in 2003-2007.
While trade growth in these years has far outpaced GDP growth (at an average of 4.5%), the two have recently been roughly the same.
Even if GDP growth exceeds trade growth this year, it is unlikely to exceed 2.7%.
The question is: Why?
According to Christina and David Romer of the University of California, Berkeley, the aftermath of modern financial crises since World War II has subsided after two to three years.
Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff say it takes a country five years to recover from a financial crisis.
And, indeed, the financial dislocations of 2007-2008 have largely subsided.
So what is the reason for the sluggish economic recovery?
One popular explanation lies in the hazy perception of secular stagnation: long-term weak demand for goods and services undermines incentives for investment and hiring.
But demand will remain weak only if people lack confidence in the future.
As Robert Gordon of Northwestern University has meticulously recorded and argued, the only logical explanation for this persistent lack of confidence is slow productivity growth.
Before the crisis, and especially between 2003 and 2007, slow productivity growth in much of the world was masked by an illusory sense of prosperity.
In some countries, including mainly the United States, Spain and Ireland, rising house prices, speculative new construction and financial risk-taking have mutually reinforced each other.
At the same time, countries have increased their growth through mutual trade.
At the center of the global boom was China, the awakening giant that flooded the world with cheap exports, thereby keeping global inflation low.
Equally important, China imported huge quantities of raw materials, supporting many African and Latin American economies, and bought German cars and machinery, keeping the regional supply chains of Europe's largest economy running.
That dynamic reversed around March 2008, when the US rescued its fifth-largest investment bank, Bear Sterns, from collapse.
With eurozone banks also mired in the sub-prime mortgage mess and suffering from a desperate shortage of US dollars, America and much of Europe mercilessly slipped into recession.
While world trade contributed to the boom years, it has now spread the decline.
As GDP growth slowed, so did individual countries "imports, which led to a slowdown in the growth of their trading partners.
Thanks to aggressive monetary policy and steps to stabilize the financial system, the US economy emerged from recession in the second half of 2009.
Eurozone policymakers, by contrast, rejected monetary stimulus and imposed fiscal austerity, while ignoring their banks "growing problems.
Thus, the eurozone pushed the world into a second global recession.
Just when this recession seemed to be over, emerging economies began to sling.
For years, observers had praised these countries "supposed governance and growth reforms.
In October 2012, the IMF celebrated its resilience.
As if that were the cue, the façade began to crumble, exposing an uncomfortable truth: factors such as high commodity prices and massive capital inflows had masked serious economic weaknesses and contributed to a culture of massive inequality and rampant corruption.
These problems are now being exacerbated by the slowdown in growth in China, the linchpin of global trade.
And the worst is yet to come.
China's vast industrial overcapacity and property glut must be reduced, the hubris of the country's global acquisitions tamed, and China's corruption networks dismantled.
In short, the factors that weighed on the global economy in 2015 will continue to persist into the new year, and in some cases even intensify.
The economies of developing and emerging economies will remain weak.
The eurozone, after a brief postponement of austerity measures, is being held back by sluggish world trade.
Rising corporate bond yields are an indication of slower growth in the US.
The collapse of assets in China could trigger financial turmoil.
And the politicians who are simply drifting lack the political capacity to act against these trends.
The IMF should stop prophesying new growth, and instead warn that the global economy will remain weak and vulnerable unless policymakers around the world act vigorously to promote innovation and growth.
The Trumpian Uncertainty
NEW YORK Every January, I try to give a forecast for the year.
Economic predictions are notoriously difficult, but while there is much truth in Harry Truman's desire for a one-sided economist (who can't say for sure), my hit rate has not been bad.
In recent years, I correctly predicted that the recovery from the Great Recession of 2008 would be slow without stronger financial stimulus (neither in Europe nor in the United States).
In making these forecasts, I have relied less on complex econometric models and more on the analysis of fundamental economic forces.
In early 2016, for example, it seemed clear that the weakness in global aggregate demand over the past few years would hardly change dramatically.
So I believed that those who believed in a stronger recovery would see the world through rose-tinted glasses.
And economic events unfolded largely as I had expected.
But the political events of 2016 were different.
I have written for many years that if the problem of growing inequality remains unresolved, particularly in the United States, but also in many other countries around the world, there will be political consequences.
But inequality has gotten worse, with disturbing data showing that people in the US are dying earlier.
Last year, a study by Anne Case and Angus Deaton found that the life expectancy of large sections of the population was falling, including those of so-called angry men from America's Rust Belt.
But, with incomes of the bottom 90% stagnant (and often falling) for nearly 30 years, the health data merely confirm that much of the country is not doing well.
The US represents one extreme of this trend, while the situation is somewhat better elsewhere.
But, while it was clear that this would have political consequences, its nature and timing were less obvious.
Why did the setback in the US come just when the economy seemed to be recovering, and not sooner?
And why has it manifested itself in the form of a shift to the right?
After all, it was Republicans who failed to support the losers of the globalization they eagerly promoted.
It was they who blocked the expansion of Medicaid in 26 states, denying health insurance to low-income people.
And why has someone who earns a living cheating on others - someone who openly admits to not paying his fair share of tax and is proud of it - won?
Donald Trump captured the spirit of the times: things were not going well, and many voters wanted change.
And they will get it now: it will not continue as before.
But seldom has there been more uncertainty.
What policies Trump will pursue remains unclear, not to mention who will benefit or what the consequences will be.
Trump seems wildly determined to start a trade war.
But how will China and Mexico react?
Trump probably understands that his proposals violate World Trade Organization rules, but he probably also knows that it will take the WTO a long time to stand up to him.
And by then, the US trade balance could be back in balance.
But he is not the only one who can play this game: China, too, can adopt such measures, though they are likely to be more subtle.
What happens when a trade war breaks out?
Trump might think he is winning, given that China is more dependent on exports to the US than the US is on exports to China, giving the US an advantage.
But a trade war is a zero-sum game.
The US will also be among the losers.
China could target its revenge in a way that causes political pain.
And the Chinese may be better able to fend off US attempts to harm them than the US can fend off Chinese attempts.
It is by no means clear which of the two is better able to withstand pain.
Is it the US, where ordinary citizens have been suffering for so long, or is it China, whose economy is still growing at more than 6% despite turbulent times?
More broadly, the Republican agenda in its Trumpian version, where the tax cut is even more targeted at the rich than the standard Republican version, is based on the idea of trickling down wealth, continuing the Reagan-era supply-side economy that has never really worked.
Fire-breathing rhetoric or three-o'clock-in-the-morning tweets might calm the anger of those left behind by the Reagan revolution for a while.
But for how long?
And what happens after that?
Perhaps Trump, with his version of economic voodoo magic, wants to override the usual economic laws.
But it doesn't work.
With the world's largest economy venturing into uncharted political waters in 2017 and beyond, it is presumptuous for a normal mortal to dare to make a prediction, but it seems certain that these waters will be so stormy that the ships of many, if not most, experts will sink along the way.
September 11 and the New Authoritarianism
Five years after the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, 9 / 11 is no longer a mere date.
It has entered the history books as the beginning of something new, perhaps a new era, but in any case a time of change.
We will also remember the terrorist bombings in Madrid, London and elsewhere, but September 11 has become a buzzword, much like August 1914.
But did a war really start on September 11, 2001?
Not everyone is happy with this American idea.
At the height of Irish terrorism in Britain, successive British governments did everything they could not to allow the IRA to go to war; war would have meant accepting the terrorists as legitimate enemies, as equals in a bloody contest in which recognised rules of engagement apply.
This is neither a correct description nor a useful terminology for terrorist acts, which are more correctly described as criminal.
By calling terrorism a war and naming an adversary, usually Al Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden, the United States government has justified domestic changes that would not have been acceptable in a free country before the 9 / 11 attacks.
Most of these changes are contained in the so-called USA Patriot Act.
Although some of the amendments concerned only administrative provisions, the overall effect was to undermine the great pillars of freedom, such as habeas corpus, the right to appeal to an independent tribunal when the state deprives a person of his or her freedom.
Very early on, the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, became a symbol of something unprecedented: the arrest of illegal fighters who were denied all human rights without trial.
The world now wonders how many of these non-human people there are in how many places in the world.
For everyone else, a kind of state of emergency has been declared, allowing the state to interfere with basic civil rights.
Border controls have become a source of anguish for many, and a number of people have suffered police harassment.
A climate of fear makes life difficult for anyone who looks or acts suspicious, especially Muslims.
When such restrictions on liberty were enacted, they met little public opposition.
On the contrary, by and large, it was the critics, not the advocates of these measures, who got into trouble.
In the United Kingdom, where Prime Minister Tony Blair fully supported the US position, the government has taken similar action, even offering a new theory.
Blair was the first to argue that security was the most important freedom.
In other words, freedom is not the individual's personal right to determine his or her own life, but the state's right to restrict individual freedom in the name of a security that only the state can define.
This is the beginning of a new authoritarianism.
The problem exists in all the countries affected by the threat of terrorism, although in many of them it is not quite as concrete.
In most countries on mainland Europe, 9 / 11 has remained an American date.
There is even debate as to whether participation in the war on terror may not have actually increased the threat of acts of terrorism, and there are some signs of that.
In any case, the Germans use this argument to stay out of the action wherever possible.
However, this attitude has not prevented the spread of a phenomenon for which a German word is also used in other languages: fear.
A diffuse concern is spreading.
People feel uncomfortable and worried, especially when travelling.
Every train crash or plane crash is now first suspected to be an act of terrorism.
Thus, directly or indirectly, 11 September was a great shock, both psychologically and for our political systems.
Although terrorism is fought in the name of democracy, the fight has in fact led to a clear weakening of democracy, owing to official legislation and widespread fear.
A troubling feature of the 9 / 11 attacks is that it is hard to see the intent behind them, other than the perpetrators "hatred of the West and its way of life.
But the West's main characteristics, democracy and the rule of law, have been dealt a far harder blow by its own defenders than by its attackers.
Above all, two steps are needed to restore confidence in freedom in the democracies affected by the legacy of 11 September.
Firstly, we must ensure that the relevant laws relating to the challenge of terrorism are purely temporary.
Some of today's restrictions on habeas corpus and civil liberties have limited validity, and all such provisions should be reviewed regularly by parliaments.
Secondly, and more importantly, our leaders must try to calm rather than exploit widespread concern.
The terrorists against whom we are currently at war cannot win, because their dark vision will never gain broad universal legitimacy.
Democrats therefore have all the more reason to stand firm in defending their values, especially by acting in accordance with them.
<unk>'s portfolio approach to climate change
The world has so far tried, largely unsuccessfully, to reduce CO2 emissions under the Kyoto Protocol.
Nevertheless, the enormous effort that it has taken to bring the Protocol into force shows how much work will be needed to bring about the next treaty, which is due to be adopted in Copenhagen in December 2009.
Its proponents will push for uncompromising and far-reaching principles, but there will continue to be strong resistance from countries worried about their economic dynamism.
The new negotiations will have an advantage over previous efforts, because governments now recognize the need for a portfolio of adaptation, mitigation, and research measures.
New research that my colleagues and I conducted for the Copenhagen Consensus Center in Denmark looks at the effectiveness of different responses to this global challenge, but strongly supports the portfolio approach for a variety of reasons.
First of all, we now know that we will have to adapt, because temperatures will rise by a further 0.6 ° C by 2100, even if we do without all climate gases tomorrow.
We also know that the effects of climate change will be felt unevenly globally.
In some areas, moderate temperature increases could lead to higher crop yields unless the changes in rainfall patterns that accompany them have a negative impact or irrigation remains feasible.
Even with a 0.6 ° C warming, however, Africa and South Asia will see near-immediate reductions in the cultivability of many crops, and eventually increased vulnerability to many infectious diseases.
These impacts will clearly hit hardest those on the planet who are already the worst off: the bottom billion, who are already bearing the brunt of disease, poverty, armed conflict and malnutrition.
A key challenge, therefore, is to broaden and harness our adaptability where it is most important.
Long-term development may enhance individual countries "ability to limit the impact of climate change on the environment and the health of their citizens, but in the meantime, the poorest on the planet depend on the help of the rich.
For example, our analysis looked at the short-term benefits of more targeted strategies: buying mosquito-resistant bed nets and oral malaria drugs to rehydrate children in the poorest countries affected by climate change.
The aim was to aggressively and proactively address some of the marginal health effects.
The benefits would take effect almost immediately, but dissipate over time as economies evolve.
Although conditions would improve as development progresses, a long-term reduction in CO2 emissions would be increasingly important in the face of the worsening impacts of climate change.
Since the effects of climate change can be observed in many parts of the world, it makes sense to think about mitigating them everywhere.
However, we have found that such cushioning alone does not stand up to a standard cost-benefit test.
We assumed that the projected annual cost of climate policy would rise proportionally to global GDP by 2100, assuming an initial figure of $18 billion.
The discounted cost of the resulting fixed annual electricity cost totaled $800 billion, but the losses avoided by this approach amounted to only $685 billion.
The Copenhagen Consensus study also examined a portfolio option of the kind advocated by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
We allocated $50 billion to research into green technologies, leaving only $750 billion to cover the economic costs of adaptation and mitigation.
The gap between zero-carbon and CO2-emitting technologies narrowed, and taxes designed to reduce emissions became more effective.
As a result, research and development was largely self-financed, and the total discounted benefit of the $800 billion investment rose to more than $2.1 trillion.
Making R & D part of the global response portfolio would make mitigation efforts more efficient and substantially increase their ability to reduce CO2 emissions over the next century.
But this net benefit is based on very conservative assumptions about the timeframe for emission reductions and when to get developing countries on board.
Optimizing investments within the portfolio over time would, for example, more than triple the discounted benefit.
The expected benefits would continue to increase if we included the chance that potentially higher climate sensitivities would exacerbate the damage, but this would require us to include similarly plausible lower climate sensitivities, with repercussions in the opposite direction.
Fighting climate change can be a sensible investment, though neither mitigation nor adaptation alone will be enough to solve the problem.
In order to make a real difference, especially in the short term, the world needs to combine mitigation and adaptation with increased research and development in carbon-saving and sequestration technology, which in turn requires the development and economic use of market-based incentives.
A <unk> reset button for Europe's backyard
STOCKHOLM - A year after the war in Georgia ended last August, it is now popular to press the <unk> reset button for diplomatic relations.
President Barack Obama recently traveled to Moscow to ease strained relations between the United States and Russia.
While there is no need for the European Union to set back because of strained relations with its eastern neighbours, it is nevertheless engaged in a deep strategic restructuring of those relations.
In May, the EU launched its new Eastern Partnership to promote further integration with the Union's six immediate neighbours - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.
The global financial crisis had made an updated and strengthened policy for the EU's eastern neighbours urgently needed.
Equally important was the fact that all the countries involved expressed the motivation to move closer to the EU.
The Eastern Partnership, which stems from a Polish-Swedish initiative, offers the six countries a significant expansion and deepening of relations with the EU in key areas.
In trade and economic relations, the objective of establishing Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTA) between the EU and partner countries is clearly defined.
The Partnership confirms full visa liberalisation as a long-term objective (for the time being with visa facilitation agreements), promises better cooperation on energy security, diversification and efficiency, and includes dedicated programmes and projects to support neighbours in their integration and reform efforts in all these areas.
Sweden's assumption of the EU presidency this month is intended to support these efforts.
However, it is taking place at a time when the Union's Eastern Neighbourhood is facing serious challenges and the financial and economic crisis is hitting many of the partner countries hard.
Ukraine is suffering from a sharp decline in global demand and trade and the consequent huge weakening of its steel industry.
Georgia's economic success was largely dependent on foreign direct investment, for which there is little demand today.
Partner countries that are less integrated into the global market, such as Moldova, are facing a slower pace of crisis, but the real effect could be equally detrimental and they are likely to recover more slowly.
The Eastern Partnership does not have a remedy that can quickly remedy the crisis.
However, it can provide policy frameworks and institution-building support to address the shortcomings that made these countries so vulnerable to the crisis: imperfect market economies, weak state institutions, and persistent corruption.
The Eastern Partnership's offer of full integration with the EU in areas such as trade and energy brings considerable transformative power.
The other type of crisis in which most of the partner countries find themselves is political.
In most of these countries, democratic development has not yet reached the point where a change of government is a normal part of political life and can take place without risking the stability of the country.
The Eastern Partnership is based on the profound values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
Political association with the EU and the process of integration within this partnership will promote reforms in these key areas.
The Swedish presidency of the EU will focus on putting the concrete work of the partnership into practice.
The establishment of a comprehensive institution-building programme to support reform of key institutions in each of the partner countries is due to take place before the end of the year.
Some of the flagship projects proposed by the European Commission are finally taking shape and new projects and initiatives are likely to be developed.
Sweden will attach particular importance to energy efficiency programmes, which will not only improve energy security and reduce costs, but will also make an important contribution to the fight against climate change.
The Swedish Presidency, together with the European Commission, intends to organise the first meeting of the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum this autumn.
We hope to see the start of parliamentary cooperation, as well as exchanges between local and regional authorities in the thirty-three EU and partner countries.
At the end of the year, EU Foreign Ministers and their counterparts from the six partner countries will meet to assess the progress made and guide the way forward.
The Eastern Partnership is about EU integration, about the six countries moving closer to the values of the EU, its legislation and its working methods, and about the EU being available to promote and support this rapprochement.
There is sometimes a perception in Russia that the partnership is directed against Russia.
This is not true, of course.
On the contrary, Russia, like Turkey, will be invited to participate in relevant activities within the multilateral dimensions of the partnership.
The Eastern Partnership is not an answer to all the problems and difficulties faced by the six partners.
Nevertheless, it represents a clear commitment by the EU to support the transition and reform of its partners by providing its political and economic support, a process that should bring prosperity and stability to the entire region.
A third way to deal with Russia
PARIS - Two alternatives defined Western strategy toward Russia as early as the mid-1990s: engage Russia if possible, but keep it in check if necessary. <unk> Russia may have changed dramatically since then, but the questions it poses remain the same.
What can be done if the great neighbour widens the existing gap between its culture, which is European, and its political system, which is increasingly Asian, at least in the wicked old sense of the word?
Is the best response to Russia's renewed imperial ambitions a modern version of a stability-oriented Holy Alliance, designed to show the world's new outsider the limits?
Is there a need for a modern version of the Yalta Conference aimed at redrawing Europe's political boundaries?
Or could the answer be a bit of both?
If Russia develops into something akin to revolutionary France under Napoleon, or returns to Soviet form, minus the totalitarian ideology, but with an appetite for conquest and recapture, it does not need the league of democracies advocated by some conservatives in America.
What is needed, then, is a league of stability that includes prominent players such as China, India and other countries more interested in economic growth than in stirring up unrest in the international system.
Such a strategy implies, first and foremost, a solid partnership with China, not because the country is moving toward democracy, but because it is a status quo power.
Such a strategy could lead to negotiations with Iran and, of course, to NATO moving closer together.
The message to the Kremlin would be crystal clear: don't be fooled.
Nationalism and imperialism do not get you anywhere; you cannot expand geographically without serious costs to your economic growth and personal prosperity.
Europe may be weak and divided; America may have passed its zenith, but with your declining population and the parlous state of your economy apart from oil and gas, you are simply not equipped to compete in the league of global superpowers.
China it is; you it is not.
But the argument fails because the Kremlin, despite everything, can stir up unrest around the world by irresponsibly siding with Syria or Venezuela.
More importantly, rallying the world against Russia alone would mean taking Russia's great-power aspirations too seriously.
Many Asians, for example, believe that Russia is now a problem for Europe, but no longer for the world as a whole.
After the end of the Cold War, Japan continued to be obsessed with Russia as the successor to the Soviet Union.
Today, the Japanese are so worried about China that they have little time for fear of Russia.
The alternative to reincarnation would be to accept the Russian argument, or, more accurately, the Russian sentiment.
This amounts to declaring: "We have unnecessarily humiliated you over the last ten years."
From NATO enlargement to the granting of independence to Kosovo, we have deliberately ignored your sensitivities and interests.
We should sit down like Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin at Yalta and reshape the European map of the twenty-first century.
What do you want back?
What do we keep?
This approach could recognize Russia's droit de regard for developments in the Caucasus.
Indeed, despite being uncompromising under the leadership of Nicolas Sarkozy's France, which currently holds the EU presidency, Europe has effectively resigned itself to the dismemberment of Georgia.
Russian troops are to remain in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
The West is not about to declare war on Russia in favour of Georgia, whose credibility has been severely damaged by its president's irresponsible actions.
As for Ukraine, it may eventually become part of the EU, but its future does not lie in NATO.
Nevertheless, a third way must be found between total containment, which is very unlikely and not necessarily desirable or realistic, and a concession bordering on appeasement, which would jeopardise Europe's future, a path based on a few firm principles.
These principles are clear.
First, Ukraine's territorial inviolability is not up for grabs.
This has been said many times, but it loses none of its meaning by repetition.
Russia without Ukraine is a nation state that can be controlled;
Russia with Ukraine is an unmanageable empire.
Second, even if the West condemns Georgia's irresponsibility and takes political account of Russia's sensitivities about its complex historical feelings about its former imperial territories, the Kremlin's shameless brutality is unacceptable.
After all, this is Europe six decades after World War II and nearly 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The use of force to settle old scores and impose the will of one nation on another cannot be tolerated passively.
In the short term, time may be on Russia's side.
In the long term, if we stick to our values and principles, it will be on our side economically, demographically, politically and strategically.
A victory for Euroscepticism
The crushing defeats suffered by many governments in the recent European Parliament elections complicate their situation ahead of this week's EU summit.
Only incorrigible optimists can hope that this summit will be a glorious occasion for one of these governments.
The Summit will finalise the text of the new EU Constitution and appoint a new President of the European Commission.
Negotiations are becoming even more difficult, given the spectacular rejection at the ballot box of a number of major governments and the strong upward trend of protest groups and eurosceptic parties in several member states.
The problem for European leaders is that their own electoral defeats do not necessarily convey the same message as the rise of Eurosceptic parties.
The record loss for Gerhard Schröder's ruling Social Democrats in Germany has little to do with his European policies, but much to do with his economic policies, which voters regard as a failure, and with Germany's persistently low growth and unemployment.
Despite the success of the nationalist parties in France, the same is true of President Jacques Chirac's centre-right party.
By contrast, in Britain, where the economy is strong and unemployment is low, the main reason for the ruling Labor Party's loss of votes was voter anger at Tony Blair's determination to go to war in Iraq alongside George Bush.
Nevertheless, the rise of Eurosceptic parties in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Poland, and the Czech Republic, has disturbing implications for a summit whose purpose is to take a small but distinctive step forward in European integration.
Particularly in Britain, the spectacular rise of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) can only reinforce long-standing latent Euroscepticism.
The draft Constitution will contain a Charter of Fundamental Rights designed to strengthen the EU's political and moral legitimacy.
But will it also strengthen the rights of EU citizens?
Or will it just be, as the British Government believes, a declaration of intent, describing only rights that already exist in the national legislations of member states?
The draft Constitution would strengthen the Union's powers of principle, with slightly more majority voting in the Council of Ministers and a stronger role for the European Parliament.
But despite Tony Blair's one-off declaration that he wanted to "put Britain at the heart of Europe," he remains unreasonably opposed to further integration and will resist any interference with British sovereignty in "sensitive areas" such as taxation, foreign policy and EU budget contributions.
Blair's Euroscepticism is understandable in that it is in line with the British position.
Opinion polls consistently show that British voters are only moderately enthusiastic about the EU, a picture confirmed by the latest Eurobarometer survey conducted across the Union on behalf of the Commission, even before enlargement from 15 to 25 member states.
One question that is always asked in this survey is whether or not voters trust the various institutions, such as national parliaments, national governments and the European Union.
Overall, confidence in the European Union is not too high: only 41% of voters tend to trust the EU, while 42% tend not to trust it.
In the UK, these figures differ dramatically: only 19% trust the EU, while 55% distrust it.
By contrast, the European Parliament is held in higher esteem than the EU as a whole: while the EU-wide average level of trust in the European Parliament is 54%, it is only 30% in the UK.
Across the EU, 48% of citizens think EU membership is a positive thing, compared to 29% in the UK.
On virtually every issue, British voters are more sceptical than voters in other countries.
One might conclude that British aversion to the EU can be explained by their support and pride in national institutions.
But that is not the case.
British confidence in the European Parliament may be only 30%, but their confidence in the British Parliament is much lower, at 19% - the lowest in the EU.
Trust in the national government is slightly higher, but still stands at only 25%, while trust in the national political parties is only 10%.
Both are also the lowest in the EU.
Voters in other states have more confidence in the EU's institutions, but faith in their own institutions is also low.
In France, 57% trust the European Parliament, while the level of trust in the French Parliament is only 29%, compared with 51% and 23%, respectively, in Germany.
The contradiction in the poll, however, is that while European voters are moderately enthusiastic about the EU and its existing institutions, 65% of voters would still support a common European foreign policy, and 72% would approve of a common defense and security policy. Even in the United Kingdom, 52% of voters support a common defense policy.
This may be a reaction to the US-led war in Iraq, but Tony Blair will rule out a common defence policy for precisely this reason, and a common European defence policy without Britain would make little sense.
The dilemma facing European leaders at this week's summit is that they are on the cusp of an unstable European integration process.
In order to remain functional after the accession of 10 new members, integration needs to be further advanced.
But it is not at all clear how governments that would normally advocate greater integration can sell this to disillusioned voters.
Tony Blair has promised a referendum on the new EU constitution, which he cannot possibly win.
The key question will be whether European leaders are deliberately using losing tactics in the hope that the problem will resolve itself.
A Bad Deal for America's Future
WASHINGTON, DC - The painfully negotiated US budget bill that President Barack Obama signed into law on August 2 combines raising the US government's debt ceiling with cutting federal spending, raising the prospect of the first default in the 224-year history of the United States.
But the agreement has three major flaws.
Two balance each other; but the third threatens what America needs most in the years ahead: economic growth.
The first mistake is that the spending cuts are ill-timed: because they come at a time when the US economy is weak, they risk triggering another recession.
The second shortcoming of the measure, however, is that the cuts in expenditure imposed here are modest.
While the law does too little to address America's chronic and rising budget deficits, the damage it is doing to the economy is likely to be limited.
But the third and most damaging mistake is that the spending cuts are taking place in the wrong places.
Because Democrats in Congress display an almost religious devotion to preserving America's most important welfare programs for seniors, Social Security and Medicare, the law leaves both untouched.
The cost of these programs will soar as the 78 million-strong Baby Boom generation - those born between 1946 and 1964 - retires and receives benefits, accounting for the largest increase in government spending and projected deficits in years to come.
And because congressional Republicans are equally allergic to tax increases, no matter when and under what circumstances, the bill does not include any tax increases for the deficit reduction it mandates, not even for the wealthiest Americans.
All the spending cuts come from the discretionary portion of the federal budget that excludes Social Security, Medicare, the Medicaid program for the poor and the interest on the national debt.
That leaves only about one-third of total federal spending for cuts, and much of that goes to the defense budget that Republicans will seek to protect.
That is, the structure created by the August 2 law focuses deficit reduction on the discretionary part of the federal budget minus defense, which accounts for only about 10% of the budget.
This is too small a pool of money to allow the deficit to be reduced on the scale that the US will need in the coming years.
Worse, discretionary spending minus defense spending includes programs that are essential to economic growth, and economic growth is essential to America's future prosperity and global standing.
Growth, for starters, is the best way to reduce the country's budget deficits.
The higher the growth rate, the more revenue the government generates without raising taxes, and higher revenues allow for smaller deficits.
Economic growth is also needed to keep the promise, which is hugely important to individual Americans, that every generation will have the chance to become wealthier than the previous generation, a popular term for which the American dream is known.
Equally important for non-Americans, only robust economic growth can ensure that the US maintains its far-reaching role in the world, which supports the global economy and contributes to stability in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East.
As Thomas L. Friedman and I explain in our forthcoming book, That Used To Be Us: How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented and How We Can Come Back, a critical factor in America's economic success is an ongoing public-private partnership dating back to the country's founding, jeopardized by the pattern of budget cuts established by the August 2 law.
Investment in infrastructure such as roads, power plants and ports that support trade; funding for research and development to expand the frontiers of knowledge in ways that produce new products; an immigration policy that attracts and keeps talented people from outside the U.S. borders; and economic regulation strong enough to prevent disasters such as the near meltdown of the financial system in 2008, but not strong enough to stifle the risk-taking and innovation that produces growth.
The first three elements of the American formula cost money, and that money is included in the discretionary part of the federal budget excluding defense, which is now targeted by the debt-ceiling law.
Cutting back on these programs will reduce America's economic growth in the long run, with negative consequences both at home and abroad.
Reducing the deficit by cutting funding for education, infrastructure, and research and development is akin to trying to reduce it by cutting off three fingers.
Most of the weight remains, but further life prospects deteriorate considerably.
Cutting deficits to raise the debt ceiling was the right thing to do, but the August 2 law tackles it the wrong way.
Unless further deficit reduction, which is inevitable, comes from limiting entitlements and raising revenue, rather than from programs vital to economic growth, the result will be a poorer, weaker America and a more uncertain, if not unstable, world.
Principles for the Convention on the European Constitution
EU President Romani Prodi has presented a proposal to strengthen the Union's executive.
Britain, France, and Spain are working on a counter-plan to strengthen the executive power of the largest EU states.
What should ordinary Europeans think?
The citizens of Europe are barely able to grasp the central issues being debated by the Convention on the drafting of a Constitution for the EU in Brussels.
Plenty of detail drowns out the crucial issues; barren, misleading national debates pitting "Eurosceptics" against "Europhiles" generate much noise and anger, but they do not provide clarity.
The issues seem so complicated that even newspapers and television stations barely report on the Convention's activities.
EU citizens, however, could provide a clearer understanding of what the Convention should achieve by asking a simple question: How should state responsibilities be distributed between the EU and its member states?
In order to answer this question, a precise idea of what the state should do is required.
The state should, first and foremost, provide citizens with services of public interest: common defence, legislation and regulation, the enforcement of the rule of law.
These can be provided at different levels of government: local, regional, national or supranational, i.e. at EU level.
But which level is the right one?
In some areas decentralisation works because it takes into account the wishes of the various local and national communities.
In our interdependent world, however, decisions taken at local level tend to have an impact on citizens of other communities and countries.
Certain services should therefore be allocated to a larger geographical entity.
Europe's decisions on how to allocate government powers to different levels should be based on the principle that European institutions are solely responsible for actions that clearly have economies of scale or where disagreements among members are minor.
Other functions - with little externalities and pronounced disagreements - should be left to national or local governments.
The reasons are clear: the benefits of centralisation are limited when there is little interdependence; highly divergent opinions mean high costs of harmonisation.
The euro, for example, has economies of scale, favours international trade and avoids negative externalities.
The Italian lira can no longer be devalued to promote Italian exports to the detriment of the French, followed by a French reaction, and so on. Nevertheless, member countries "imperfectly synchronized business cycles create divergent views on monetary policy.
Europe has rightly decided that the benefits of the euro outweigh the costs of diversification.
But imposing the same public education system on all members in education policy would not create economies of scale.
Cultural differences are too great and it would therefore be absurd to delegate education and culture to a supranational level.
There are two outstanding areas of public policy that have significant economies of scale or externalities: the common market and competition, and foreign policy and defence.
The former covers antitrust, trade and the single currency.
Some believe that fiscal policy should also be harmonised, from the structuring of taxation to social benefits and the balancing of the budget.
Mechanical harmonisation, however, would be difficult due to different national preferences and could provoke resistance.
From a constitutional point of view, fiscal policy has no real raison d'être.
The US Constitution, for example, does not require states to balance their budgets.
Fiscal harmonization could only be justified in special circumstances: prohibitions on tax incentives, for example, used to restrict competition or international trade, or to limit the movement of capital.
Foreign and military policy are par excellence at the top of the government.
There are clear externalities and economies of scale.
It would be absurd for New York to pursue a different foreign policy in America than Texas.
It is not much different in Europe.
The enlargement of the Union to include new members means that there will be even more internal differences, which in turn means that a less centralised policy is justified.
These considerations suggest a number of principles for the members of the Convention:
1. The European Constitution should clearly define which prerogatives belong to Europe and which to the member states.
When in doubt, the principle of subordination suggests that nation states retain preference;
2. Institutions at European level should ensure the functioning of markets, including competition, economic and monetary policy;
3. Fiscal areas should remain largely decentralised, with a few exceptions;
4. Foreign policy and defence are areas of federal competence which are delegated to Europe in the right and timely way;
5. The creation of new areas of federal competence should be accompanied by decision-making mechanisms as found in truly representative democracies.
So "no centralisation without representation."
Unfortunately, as the table shows, today's EU deviates enormously from these principles: agriculture, which represents 2% of European GDP, accounts for 40% of European expenditure.
Breakdown by area of activity of the European Union

3115.
Europe is opening up a historic opportunity.
The fathers of the American Constitution wrote a document that has endured in its basic structure for more than 200 years.
The society that the members of the European Convention have to deal with is in many ways different and far more complex.
But they can prove comparable wisdom and farsightedness.
A Balanced View of Sino-American Imbalances
BEIJING Until July 2007, most economists agreed that global imbalances were the biggest threat to global growth.
It has been argued that the rising net foreign debt ratio of the United States as a result of chronic current account deficits would severely curb capital inflows, which in turn would weaken the dollar, push up interest rates and plunge the U.S. economy into crisis.
But that scenario has not materialized.
Instead, the crisis stems from the US mortgage debacle, which quickly dragged the global economy into the deepest recession since the 1930 "s.
Most economists did not foresee the economic dynamism that actually led to the crisis, because they did not pay enough attention to the rapid increase in US total debt.
Instead, they focused exclusively on US foreign debt, ignoring private debt (mortgage and consumer debt), public debt, corporate debt, and financial debt.
In particular, they should have paid more attention to the sustainability of American mortgage and consumer debt.
In 2007, the ratio of mortgage and consumer debt to GDP was over 90%, compared to net external debt of 24%.
Of course, the various debt components vary considerably in character and sources of funding, and therefore in sustainability.
But all the components of a country's total debt and its types of financing are interconnected.
Two things arise from this.
First, funds from different sources of funding are interchangeable to some extent: missing funds for one component of the total debt can be supplemented by surplus funds originally intended for financing other components.
Second, difficulties in any component of total debt have an impact on all other components.
After the mortgage crisis broke out, households either paid off part of the mortgage and consumer debt with their savings or became insolvent.
The reduction in total US debt and the narrowing of the funding gap between total debt and domestic funds led to a significant improvement in the US current account deficit in 2008 and 2009, refuting Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernake's claim that the deficit was caused by a global savings glut.
Indeed, America's current account was strengthening, even as the dollar appreciated on demand for a safe haven.
But, owing to deleveraging in the private sector and an increase in private saving, the US economy, driven by debt and consumption, unfortunately slipped into recession.
To offset the negative impact of private-sector deleveraging, the US government has pursued expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.
Now that private debt has been kept on a knife-edge following feverish government intervention, public finances have deteriorated sharply and the current account has weakened again.
Public debt sustainability has replaced private debt sustainability as the biggest threat to financial stability, and the focus of the debate on the US current account has shifted from external debt sustainability to the impact of external debt reduction on growth and employment.
The dilemma that US policymakers face is how to stimulate growth while reducing the overall level of debt.
The best way to achieve both objectives is to increase exports by strengthening US competitiveness.
But where will increased competitiveness come from?
Depreciation of the dollar could improve US competitiveness in the short term, but that is not a solution.
With investors now worried about capital losses on US government bonds, owing to the rapid deterioration of the fiscal position, devaluation would make foreigners even more reluctant to finance America's budget deficit.
If there is no foreign financing, interest rates on US government debt will rise, and the US economy will fall back into recession.
In the long run, America's growth pattern must undergo a structural shift, from dependence on debt and consumption to growth based on Americans "much-vaunted capacity for creativity and innovation.
Only then will America become so competitive that the government can reduce both private and public debt to sustainable levels, while maintaining a respectable growth rate.
But neither improving competitiveness nor reducing total debt can be achieved overnight.
In the short term, the US current-account deficit will remain, regardless of which country runs bilateral surpluses.
As a result, China's consistent reinvestment of its current-account surplus in US government bonds is crucial to US growth and financial stability.
Given that America benefits greatly from China's purchases of US Treasuries, it is hard to understand why the US government and Congress complain so much about the bilateral current-account deficit.
Equally difficult to understand is why China is so reluctant to reduce its bilateral surplus, given that profits on its massive holdings of US Treasuries are paltry and the risk of large capital losses persists in the future.
The good news is that, following President Hu Jintao's recent visit to Washington, both America and China have taken positive steps to resolve their differences over the bilateral current account.
This bodes well for a more rational and constructive Sino-American dialogue on global imbalances, which would certainly benefit the global economy.
Small steps towards banking union
BRUSSELS At the start of the financial crisis, Charles Goodhart's pithy assertion that banks were "international in life and national in death" was often heard.
Back then (2008-2009), big international banks had to be bailed out by their home governments when they were in trouble.
But now the opposite is a problem in Europe: banks are dying nationally.
In Spain, for example, regional savings banks (cajas) financed an outsized boom in the real estate sector.
When the bubble burst, losses threatened to overwhelm the Spanish state's capacity, and the problem became European, because it threatened the very survival of the euro.
The case of Spain is symptomatic of an overarching problem.
National supervisors tend to make problems at home smaller than they are.
Their instinct (and bureaucratic interest) dictates that they should defend their own banks against other countries.
But their opposition to addressing problems at home goes deeper.
Until recently, the Spanish authorities maintained that the problems in their country's real estate sector were only temporary.
If they had admitted the truth, it would have been to overlook for years the emergence of a construction bubble that is now threatening to bankrupt the entire country.
In Ireland, the situation was not much different at first.
When the problems came to the surface, the then finance minister claimed the country was about to undertake the cheapest bank bailout ever.
Given the predictable tendency of national supervisors to overlook problems at home, it seemed only logical that the cost of rescuing failing banks would also be borne at national level.
It seemed reasonable for banking supervision in the eurozone, too, to remain largely in national hands.
The recently created European Banking Authority (EBA) has limited powers vis-à-vis national supervisors, whose day-to-day work is mainly guided by national considerations.
But reality has shown that this approach is untenable.
Problems may arise at the national level, but monetary union quickly threatens the stability of the eurozone's entire banking system.
At their summit in June, European leaders finally recognized the need to change this situation and gave the European Central Bank responsibility for banking supervision in the eurozone.
Given that financial integration within the monetary union is particularly strong, it was an obvious step to strengthen the ECB in this regard.
Moreover, the ECB already has de facto responsibility for the stability of the banking system within the eurozone.
But until now, it has had to lend large sums to banks without being able to verify their soundness, because the information was in the hands of the national authorities, who jealously guarded them and usually suppressed the problems until it was too late.
Giving responsibility to the ECB should also help to halt the creeping disintegration process, which is not publicly visible but nevertheless very real.
Just ask one of the large international banking groups headquartered in a cash-strapped eurozone country.
Take a bank with headquarters in Italy and a large subsidiary in Germany.
German businesses normally generate a return on capital (because the saving rate in Germany far exceeds investment on average).
The parent company now intends to use these funds to strengthen the group's liquidity.
But German regulators see Italy as a high-risk candidate and refuse to authorise a transfer.
The supervisory authority of the country of origin (Italy) has the opposite interest.
She wants to see as much activity as possible in the domestic capital market.
Here, too, it would make sense to have a neutral arbitrator in the ECB for these conflicting interests.
But, while transferring banking supervision responsibilities to the ECB solves one problem, it creates another: can national authorities be held responsible for savings banks that no longer supervise them?
Economic (and political) logic calls for a common eurozone bank rescue fund.
Officially, this has not yet been recognised.
But that is how the European integration process often works: an incomplete step in one area will require further steps in related areas later on.
This step-by-step approach has worked well in the past, which has led, among other things, to the European Union in its present form.
But a financial crisis does not give policymakers the time they once had to explain to their constituents why one step leads to the next; they must act much faster to save the euro.
A Berlin consensus?
HONG KONG - A recent trip to Berlin reminded me of an earlier visit there in the summer of 1967, when I was a poor student marvelling at the Wall that would divide and devastate an entire society for two more decades.
Today Berlin is alive and young again, built up by the hard work and willingness of Germans to make sacrifices for the reunification of the country. An appropriate place for the conference of the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET), which I attended there.
The theme of the conference was <unk> Paradigm Lost <unk>, with more than 300 economists, political scientists, system analysts and ecologists looking for new theoretical approaches to economics and policy that address the challenges and uncertainties caused by rising inequality, rising unemployment, the global financial crisis and climate change.
Almost everyone agreed that the old paradigm of neoclassical economics was no longer valid, but there was no agreement on a replacement.
Nobel laureate Amartya Sen attributed the European crisis to a quadruple failure: political, economic, social, and intellectual.
The global financial crisis, which began in 2007 as the US subprime crisis and expanded into a European sovereign-debt (and banking) crisis, has raised questions that we cannot answer because of over-specialization and knowledge fragmentation.
And yet we cannot deny that the world has become too complex for a simple, overarching theory to explain demanding economic, technical, demographic, and environmental changes.
The rise of emerging economies, in particular, poses a challenge to the West's traditional deductive and inductive logic.
Deductive conclusions allow us to foresee consequences if we know the principles (the rule) and the cause.
By inductive conclusions we deduce the principles from the cause and the consequences.
Eastern thinking, by contrast, takes an abductive pragmatic approach and tries to derive the next steps from it.
Abductive conclusions are pragmatic and result-oriented, derive the rule and identify the cause.
As in historiography, socio-scientific theory is written by the victors and shaped by the context and challenges of the time.
The free-market theory stems from Anglo-Saxon theorists (many of them Scots) who emigrated and colonized countries, suggesting to happy individuals that consumption had no limits.
Because of urbanization and the need for a social order, theorists in continental Europe emphasized institutional analysis in the context of economic policy.
The emergence of neoclassical economics in the 19th century was strongly influenced by the physics of Newton and Descartes, and evolved from qualitative analysis to quantification of human behavior by presupposing rational behavior and excluding uncertainties.
This pre-determined equilibrium thinking is also reflected in the view that markets always self-regulate, which led to political paralysis until the Great Depression of 1929, when John Maynard Keynes's argument for government intervention to combat unemployment and fill output gaps began to take hold.
Until the 1970s, the neoclassical school of general equilibrium translated Keynes's economic theses into real models that assumed that finance was a veil and therefore blind to the destabilizing effects of the financial market.
Economists like Hyman Minsky, who tried to correct this, were largely ignored when Milton Friedman and others led the profession's march toward free markets and minimal government intervention.
But then technology, demography, and globalization brought dramatic new challenges that the neoclassical approach could not have foreseen.
As the world's most advanced countries financed their runaway consumption with derivatives, four of the world's seven billion people began to move toward middle-income status, putting considerable pressure on global resources and raising the question of environmental sustainability.
To manage these fundamental and systemic changes, and to integrate giants like China and India into the modern world, we need a new way of thinking.
It is not only the West that needs to rethink, but also the East.
In 1987, Ray Huang declared this for China:
As the world enters the modern age, most countries, under internal and external pressure, must reinvent themselves by replacing the form of government rooted in the agricultural experience with a new set of rules based on trade.
The process of renewal could affect the upper and lower strata of society, and it will be necessary to work through the institutional links between them.
Complete destruction is often needed, and it can take decades to get the job done.
Using this macro-historical framework, we conceive of Japanese deflation, European debt, and even the Arab Spring as different phases of systemic change within complex structures that interact with each other in a new, multipolar global system.
We are witnessing global convergence (the reduction of income, wealth, and knowledge disparities between countries) and local divergence (the building of income, wealth, and knowledge disparities within countries).
Adaptive systems struggle with order and creativity as they evolve.
As the philosopher Bertrand Russell put it presciently: "Security and justice require central government control, which must be transferred to the creation of a world government if it is to be effective."
Progress, on the other hand, requires the broadest possible framework for self-initiative, which is still compatible with the social order.
A new wave of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called "creative destruction" is emerging: Even as banks flood markets with liquidity, lending to businesses and households is shrinking.
We live in a time of simultaneous inflation and deflation, of unprecedented prosperity in the midst of growing inequality, technological progress and the simultaneous depletion of raw materials.
In the meantime, existing political systems promise good jobs, sound governance, a sustainable environment and social harmony without sacrifices - a self-serving free-rider's paradise that can only be sustained by the loss of the natural environment and the well-being of future generations.
We cannot permanently suppress the pain of adjustment by printing money.
Sustainability can only be achieved if the wealthy are willing to make sacrifices for the have-nots.
The Washington Consensus, which imposed economic reforms on developing countries, has been over for two decades.
The INET conference in Berlin made clear the need for a new consensus, a consensus that supports sacrifice in the interests of unity.
A better and safer Europe
The accession of former Soviet republics such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to NATO is a dream come true for many, including myself.
When the idea of NATO enlargement to the Baltic states first emerged about ten years ago, very few people took it seriously.
Until recently, Russia's resolute opposition was also a serious obstacle, because it gave the impression that Russia viewed its so-called "surrounding foreign country" as a special zone of interest and influence.
NATO enlargement now makes it clear that in the new Europe, no country is considered part of another country's "zone of influence."
For the three small Baltic states, this ensures that the nightmare of occupation by neighboring states that they endured for half a century (first by Hitler's German Reich and then by Stalin's USSR) will not happen again.
By overcoming Russia's revanchist tendencies towards the Baltic states, Europe will become safer and Russia will receive support in its efforts to define itself in the future as a nation state and not as a czarist empire.
Enlargement also creates a better Europe, because it widens the circle of countries that are committed to NATO's political values, individual rights and minority rights.
Fortunately, Russia now seems to be aware of this political aspect of NATO enlargement.
And rightly so: NATO enlargement is not an "expansion" that threatens Russia or other countries seeking democratic reforms.
With enlargement, concerns - real or imagined - about the situation of the Russian-speaking population, who now live outside Russia but within the former borders of the Soviet Union, will disappear.
The civil rights of Russian minorities in the Baltic States and elsewhere are now being enshrined in law, not least because NATO has demanded it.
NATO's civil-rights initiatives reflect the increasingly professional way in which Russia, Europe, and America are now resolving their differences.
For example, NATO enlargement comes just a few days after the agreement reached between Russia and the EU on the difficult issue of transit to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.
This small part of Russia, situated on the Baltic Sea and with one million inhabitants, lies exactly between the two future EU member states Poland and Lithuania.
This geographical position would have created a complicated situation for Russians who would have faced strict visa requirements when travelling between Kaliningrad and Russia.
An agreement has now been signed by President Putin and the EU to facilitate this transit without jeopardising the status of Poland or Lithuania within the EU.
This, in turn, has made all parties feel like winners, which is crucial for the future relationship between the EU and Russia.
When the European Council in Copenhagen next month finally decides on the eastward enlargement of the EU, one thing is certain: thanks to the decisions of NATO and the EU in the decisive autumn of 2002, Europe has become a safer and better place to live.
However, that is no reason for complacency, because the really hard work is still ahead of us: dealing with all the internal practical and political problems that these enlargements will entail, and also negotiating with countries on hold, of which Russia, in particular, is the prime example.
Relations with Russia are essential if Europe is to continue to improve the quality of life of its citizens and respond adequately to their security needs.
The common threat of international terrorism must be addressed jointly.
We must convince each other that, in the fight against the common enemy, we have to weigh the need for security and human and minority rights very carefully against each other.
Kaliningrad could be the litmus test for these relations.
With the Transit Agreement, the first hurdle has already been cleared.
The next challenge is to support Kaliningrad in the fight against disease and crime and to strengthen its economic and social structures.
The EU's generosity will be required, as will Moscow's flexibility.
More broadly, this could lead to a strengthening of the EU's so-called northern dimension, which has set itself the goal of a free trade area for all countries around the Baltic Sea.
Major projects of this kind can be carried out if the political will is there and can be implemented.
Only a few years ago, EU and NATO enlargements were utopias.
But through determination and political will, utopias have become reality.
Now is the time for Europe to set itself ambitious new goals.
A Better Way to Reduce Nuclear Risks
When I served in President Jimmy Carter's State Department in 1977, I was sent to India to dissuade that country's leaders from developing an atomic bomb.
My hosts replied that they had to keep up with China.
I replied that Pakistan would inevitably follow suit, making the world a less secure place.
India promised not to export its weapons technology.
As far as we know, its leaders have kept their word.
However, the revelations about the nuclear arms smuggling network organized by the father of the Pakistani bomb, A. Q. Khan, confirm the danger I predicted at the time.
Some call Khan's network an attempt to spread an "Islamic bomb." Given that North Korea was on the list of recipients along with Libya and Iran, it might be better called a corrupt bomb.
As events in Pakistan show, the proliferation of nuclear technology will not increase the stability that comes with mutual deterrence.
Rather, it increases the likelihood of corrupt leaks that can give terrorist groups access to nuclear weapons.
Everyone is less safe.
Any pathological extremist group could destroy New Delhi, Tokyo, Paris, or any other city of its choosing.
The world's attention is focused on Iran, one of the recipients of Pakistani technology, as the country that seems most eager to develop its own nuclear arsenal.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran began enriching uranium in a first centrifuge last August and is building larger underground enrichment facilities.
Iran says its programs are for peaceful production of nuclear energy, but inspectors have already found traces of highly enriched, weapons-grade uranium.
Last October, IAEA Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei announced that Iran had agreed to more comprehensive inspection procedures.
Following visits by the French, British and German foreign ministers, Iran also announced a temporary suspension of its enrichment programme.
It now suggests that it could continue enriching, and recent press reports on imports from Pakistan suggest that Iran has not told the IAEA everything.
Iran claims that as a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), it has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes.
Correct, because there is a loophole in the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Even if a country agrees to wide-ranging IAEA inspections, it can legally accumulate enriched uranium (or reprocessed plutonium) under the guise of a peaceful energy program, and then surprisingly declare that circumstances have changed and withdraw from the treaty - capable of producing nuclear weapons in the short term.
If Iran did so, not only would it create additional dangers in an unstable region, but it would probably set in motion a process that would dissolve the non-proliferation regime worldwide.
Iran might ask what right others have to demand that it renounce nuclear weapons.
The answer lies both in the fact that it promised not to do so when it signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty and in the consequences that others would have to draw from it.
For these reasons, President Bush declared an Iranian nuclear weapon unacceptable.
But America's unilateral options are limited.
Not only has the US army been doing just that in Iraq, but the way the US entered Iraq - which, it turns out, has less nuclear potential than Iran - has undermined American credibility, making it difficult to find allies to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions.
Fortunately, there is a multilateral option and an existing precedent.
In the mid-1970s, many parties to the NPT planned to import and develop enrichment and reprocessing plants.
Countries as diverse as the Soviet Union, France, Germany, and Japan recognized the threat to the non-proliferation regime and formed a "group of major nuclear suppliers," imposing restrictions on exports of enrichment and reprocessing plants.
That plugged part of the loophole in the treaty without changing it.
Such countries should join forces today to propose a deal to Iran (and others).
Countries that want to develop nuclear energy but not atomic bombs should receive international guarantees on the supply of fuel and the disposal of spent fuel.
For example, Russia, which is helping Iran build a nuclear reactor at Bushehr, should offer Iran a guarantee on low-enriched uranium fuel and the reprocessing of the fuel consumed by the reactor, which would be sent back to Russia if Iran agreed to renounce enrichment and reprocessing.
This agreement can then be made effective by the UN Security Council.
The Security Council would declare that the further proliferation of nuclear weapons constitutes a threat to peace, and that any country moving in this direction would be subject to sanctions.
Such a resolution would also include an incentive by guaranteeing Iran access to the non-hazardous components of the nuclear fuel cycle.
This can be sweetened by offering to ease existing sanctions and provide a security guarantee if Iran remains nuclear-free.
European foreign ministers have already expressed concerns about Iran's nuclear programme.
Russia indicates that it is prepared to provide such a supply and disposal of fuel.
It is time for the Security Council to try to internationalize the most dangerous parts of the nuclear fuel cycle.
It is not too late to learn a lesson from the misfortunes of A. Q. Khan.
Big opportunity for small farmers
NEW YORK The G-8 "s $20 billion initiative for smallholder farmers, launched at the group's recent summit in L'Aquila, Italy, is potentially a historic breakthrough in the fight against hunger and extreme poverty.
If the new funds are properly managed, food production in Africa will soar.
Indeed, the new initiative, along with others on health, education and infrastructure, could be the biggest step yet toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals, the internationally agreed effort to halve extreme poverty, disease and hunger by 2015.
From 2002 to 2006, I led the United Nations Millennium Project, which aimed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, for then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
A cornerstone of the project has been small-scale farmers, i.e. farming families in Africa, Latin America and Asia who work on farms of about one hectare or less.
They are among the poorest households in the world and, ironically, also among the hungriest, even though they are food producers.
They are starving because they cannot buy high-yielding seeds, fertilizers, irrigation equipment, and other tools needed to increase productivity.
As a result, their harvest is poor and insufficient for their livelihood.
Their poverty leads to low agricultural productivity, and low agricultural productivity increases their poverty.
It is a vicious circle known in technical terms as a poverty trap.
The UN Millennium Project Hunger Task Force, led by two of the world's leading scientists, M. S. Swaminathan and Pedro Sanchez, examined how to break this vicious circle. It found that Africa could substantially increase its food production if smallholder farmers were helped in the form of agricultural inputs.
The Millennium Project recommended a major increase in global funding for this purpose. Against the background of this work and similar scientific findings, Annan called for a Green Revolution in Africa in 2004, based on an expanded partnership between Africa and donor countries.
Many of us, particularly the current UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, have worked hard to make this possible, with Ban repeatedly highlighting the particular emergency created by the global food, financial, and energy crises of the past two years.
The G-8 announcement reflects these years of effort and, of course, the boost provided by the leadership of US President Barack Obama, Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Zapatero, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, World Bank President Robert Zoellick, European Commissioner Louis Michel, MEP Thijs Berman, and others.
What matters most now is that these efforts work.
The lessons of history are clear.
Providing seeds and fertilizer to smallholder farmers at highly subsidized (or in some cases even free) prices will make a lasting difference.
Not only will food yields increase in the short term, but agricultural households, with their higher incomes and better health, will accumulate all sorts of assets and benefits: bank balances, soil nutrients, farm animals, and health and education for their children.
This increase in their wealth, in turn, enables local credit markets, such as microfinance institutions, to function.
Farmers can buy inputs either with their own funds or because of their improved creditworthiness.
Consensus has now been reached on the need to help small farmers, but obstacles remain.
Perhaps the main risk is that the aid bureaucracies will now stumble across each other in an attempt to get their hands on the $20 billion, so much of the money will be swallowed up by meetings, expert consultations, expenses, reports and other meetings.
If donor governments really want results, they should wrest the money from the thirty or more separate aid bureaucracies and pool it in one or two places; the most logical focal points would be the World Bank in Washington and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in Rome.
One or both organizations would then have a multi-billion dollar account.
Governments in famine-stricken regions, especially in Africa, would then submit national action plans detailing how they would use donor funds to provide high-yield seeds, fertilizers, irrigation systems, agricultural equipment, storage silos, and local advice to impoverished farmers.
An independent panel of experts would examine the national plans to confirm their scientific and operational correctness.
Assuming a plan passes the test, the money for its support would be disbursed quickly.
The national programmes would then be monitored, revised and evaluated.
This approach is direct, efficient, comprehensible and scientifically sound.
Two major recent development success stories have followed this approach: the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, which successfully vaccinates infants, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, which supports national action plans to combat these deadly diseases.
Both have saved millions of lives over the last decade and paved the way for a new, more efficient and scientifically sound approach to development aid.
Not surprisingly, many UN agencies and aid agencies in rich countries are fighting this approach.
All too often, these struggles are about territorial issues rather than the most effective way of getting aid to the poor as quickly as possible.
Obama, Rudd, Zapatero, and other forward-thinking leaders can therefore make a huge difference by honoring their promises made at the G-8 summit and insisting that aid really works.
Bureaucracies must be bypassed in order to get aid to where it is needed: the land cultivated by the world's poorest peasant families.
A black and white question
NEW YORK - On the afternoon of July 16, two men appeared to break into an upscale home in an upscale neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts.
A police officer arrived at the scene after being alerted by telephone.
He saw a black man in the house and told him to get out.
The man refused.
The policeman asked him to identify himself.
The man, who still refused to leave the house, said he was a professor at Harvard, showed his ID and warned the police officer not to mess with him.
He said something about the fact that black men were particularly targeted in America and asked the white police officer for his name and service number.
The policeman, now supported by several colleagues, arrested the professor for disorderly conduct.
We now know that the professor broke into his own house with the help of his driver after the front door jammed.
What was unusual in this case was not the rigour of the policeman.
Most people in the US know that if you defy their orders, the police can quickly become very uncomfortable.
The fact that the suspect was a black man may or may not have led the police officer to reach for the handcuffs faster than usual.
That, too, would not have been unusual.
The truly extraordinary thing about this case was that Henry Louis Gates is one of the most respected professors in the country, famous for his books, articles and numerous television appearances.
He is a highly influential figure in the world of science and media, and a friend of President Barack Obama.
So he warned the policeman, Sergeant James Crowley, a long-serving member of the Cambridge police, not to mess with him.
In the USA, belonging to a certain class of people and skin colour partly overlap.
In this particular case, it is impossible to separate them.
Gates, who is acutely aware of this problem, even a specialist in the field of race issues and their history in his country, instinctively suspected that he had been the victim of prejudice.
But, as his remarks show, he was equally aware that he would not be treated with the respect he deserved as an eminent Harvard professor and media star.
In an interview with his daughter published online, he put it this way: "[Crowley] could have pulled out of the affair if he had said," I'm sorry, sir, I wish you well. "
I like your [TV] show <unk> we'll sort that out later! '
Unfortunately, Sergeant Crowley had never heard of Professor Gates.
As a local, whose brothers all work for the police, a sports fan and basketball coach at an amateur club, Crowley doesn't move in the same circles as Gates.
So the ad was withdrawn, and it might have been stopped if President Obama, tired and frustrated after weeks of fighting over his health care reform, had not intervened on behalf of his friend, Gates, calling the police "stupid."
Both the president and Gates said lessons must be learned from the incident.
Gates is even said to be planning a television documentary about racial profiling, which involves arbitrary police checks based on a person's skin color.
There is one thing to be learned from events, if it is not already known: how easily ethnic sensitivities boil over in American daily life despite the election of a black president.
The complex web of black anger, white guilt, and black and white fear is so irritating that most Americans would rather not talk about it at all.
The area is a minefield.
One of Obama's standout achievements is that he made it a serious issue because of the brilliance and subtlety of his rhetoric.
And there is plenty to talk about: the grotesquely disproportionate number of black men in US prisons; the lack of educational opportunities in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods; the appalling health care system; and the very real brutality of police officers against blacks who do not have the privilege of a Harvard ID card.
One thing is probably true: many white police officers, even if trained, like Sergeant Crowley, to avoid racially motivated policing, have yet to be convinced that a black man lives in one of the more upscale homes in Cambridge or any other American city.
But is the Gates affair really the right way to enter this discussion?
You could argue that she was.
Who, if not Professor Gates?
It is precisely because it is a capacity that it is able to draw national attention to this serious issue.
If the same thing had happened to an unknown person from Harlem or another poor or predominantly black neighborhood, no one would have known about it.
The fact that this happened to a professor at Cambridge shakes up the general public.
Nevertheless, there is a risk that this will also have a detrimental effect on the necessary national debate on skin colour.
A Bollywood bride for Sarkozy?
PARIS French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been in trouble ever since he publicly announced his affair with former supermodel and pop musician Carla Bruni during a romantic trip to Disneyland Paris, removing him from his country's most coveted bachelors list.
His approval ratings have dropped below 50% for the first time.
Older French citizens do not find the public spectacle of their father in love particularly amusing.
Abroad, Egypt's parliamentarians were so enthused by the prospect that the French leader could share a bed with his girlfriend that several of them publicly vented their displeasure in parliament.
Likewise, India is deeply embarrassed about how to protocol Sarkozy's upcoming visit to the subcontinent as a guest of honor at Republic Day celebrations on January 26.
Should the presidential girlfriend get her own convoy of vehicles, like a presidential wife?
The same right-wing Hindu groups that have been protesting Valentine's Day as a decadent Western holiday warn that if Sarkozy arrived with girlfriend in tow, they would welcome him into the streets.
The controversy threatens to cast a shadow over a much-heralded summit of two of the world's largest democracies.
With lucrative deals for the expensive products that drive the French economy - military hardware, nuclear power plants and Airbus aircraft - at stake, France has a strong interest in a summit success in India.
So, as rumors swirl of a secret marriage, either already under way or in the pipeline, one wonders whether simmering anger in India over the French president's very public love life is behind the rush to legally marry the couple?
The news in Sarkozy's Journal du Dimanche that the two were planning their wedding has sparked feverish speculation as to when the happy event might occur.
The two exchanged clear symbols of their mutual affection: he gave her a heart-shaped pink diamond ring from Dior, and she gave him a Swiss watch.
'It's serious, 'the president admitted.
But even when asked directly by reporters, he refused to divulge an exact date, and <unk> will find out in hindsight, 'he sneered.
The couple are rumoured to have set February 8 or 9 as their wedding day.
Others say Sarkozy tricked the media by holding a secret wedding at the Elysee Palace while dodging questions about his marriage plans.
If this is true, Sarkozy has missed a golden opportunity.
If the couple were already burning in photos with Luxor and Petra as their backdrop, just imagine how hot things could get at the most romantic place on earth, the Taj Mahal.
And, given that everything that comes out of Bollywood is all the rage in France right now, a lavish Indian wedding would fit the picture well.
Bruni's own life path is very similar to that of a large number of Bollywood stars who have made the transition from model to actress.
A graceful brunette who sings is perfect for a Bollywood makeover.
The Indian government, in any case, would be relieved to see the presidential girlfriend become a presidential wife.
Lest there be any misunderstanding, the Indian Express, one of India's leading dailies, made it quite clear to its readers: "A girlfriend is not a wife or wife."
Despite the sometimes downright pornographic screen twists of Bollywood starlets, India remains a deeply conservative society.
Divorce is something unheard of.
(Sarkozy is now divorced twice.)
And while the privileged classes are teeming with mistresses, they are not strutting their stuff in public alongside their powerful friends.
Kisses and smooches in public are taboo, even for married people.
In this respect, India is more like the France with which Sarkozy is seeking a smooth break than it is today.
Most Indians, like apparently many French, would prefer not to get rid of the "hypocrisy" that Sarkozy accuses his predecessors (read: former French President François Mitterrand, who had a child with his mistress that no one knew about before Mitterrand's funeral).
Sarkozy, in particular, should know that much of the dignity of his office rests on splendor and ceremonial.
Statecraft is an area in which appearances are supposed to be deceptive.
When Sarkozy, with his otherwise fine antenna for the media, complains that he is no different from other men, he is dangerously close to confusing the office and the person of the president.
Most French people can only dream of an exotic wedding in India.
Sarkozy could make that dream a reality.
If he is indeed as head over heels in love with Bruni as he claims and wants to marry her soon, why not use his upcoming trip to India to make this an unforgettable wedding?
He could meet his bride majestically sitting on the saddle of an artfully decorated elephant, and she would simply look gorgeous in the finest Indian cloth and jewels.
The <unk> bling-bling president, as Sarkozy is now known, could wear as much gold as he likes and lavish his bride with even more diamonds.
The film cameras would run, Indians would smile, and France would be treated to a Bollywood spectacle beyond its wildest dreams.
And if it's too late for the wedding itself, the reception will still be there.
Fukushima and the risk of nuclear proliferation
Twenty-five years after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the renewed disaster in Fukushima, Japan, has hopefully finally made it clear that the supposed blessings of the nuclear age are simply illusions: nuclear power is neither clean, safe, nor cheap.
On the contrary, nuclear power has three major unresolved risks: plant safety, nuclear waste, and the risk of military proliferation.
Furthermore, the alternatives to nuclear power generation are well known and technically far more modern and sustainable than fossil fuels or nuclear power.
There is no need to take the nuclear risk; this is obviously politically desirable.
Fossil and nuclear fuels are among the technological utopias of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that thrived on the belief in the innocence of technological feasibility and the fact that, globally at the time, only a predominantly Western minority benefited from the blessings of this progress.
The 21st century will be shaped by the experience of the finite nature of the global ecosystem and its resources, and by the consequent sustainable responsibility for the preservation of this ecosystem, which is indispensable for us humans.
Therein lies a huge technical challenge and also an opportunity.
The energy future of 9 billion people in the middle of this century does not lie in fossil fuels or nuclear energy, but solely in renewable energy sources and dramatically improved energy efficiency.
We already know this all too well.
Why, then, are the most developed countries, in particular, taking on this once again proven risk of a major national disaster just to generate electricity from radioactive decay?
The ultimate answer to this question lies not only, and above all, in the civilian, but in the military utility of nuclear energy.
The energy from the fission of uranium and plutonium atoms was originally used for the ultimate weapon, the atomic bomb.
It promises sovereign states the ultimate power, military protection and prestige of a nuclear power.
To this day, the disposal of this weapon divides the world of states into two classes, the few nuclear powers and the many have-nots.
The old Cold War world order was founded in 1949 on the nuclear arms race between the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union.
And in order to prevent the numerous members of the world from joining this arms race and trying to become nuclear powers themselves, thereby contributing to the multiplication and proliferation of the risk of nuclear confrontation, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was negotiated and enacted in the 1960 "s, which still governs relations between the nuclear powers and the rest on the basis of renunciation (have-nots) and nuclear disarmament obligations (nuclear powers).
To be sure, this Treaty has been breached or undermined on several occasions by states that have never acceded to it.
To this day, therefore, there remains a risk that the number of nuclear powers will increase, especially for small and medium-sized powers, which hope that such a move will enhance their position in regional conflicts and, furthermore, enhance their prestige.
Iran is the latest example of this.
However, the threat of the nuclearization of such not always very stable states and the accompanying nuclear build-up of the world's numerous regional conflicts would make the twenty-first century much less secure and also significantly increase the risk that nuclear weapons could eventually end up in the hands of terrorists.
Despite the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the clear separation between the civilian and military uses of nuclear energy has not always and does not really work, because under the rule of the Treaty, all signatory states are allowed, under international control, to develop and use all components of the nuclear fuel cycle for civilian purposes.
From there, all that is needed are fewer technological steps and a political decision by the respective national leaders to take the step towards nuclear power.
But it is this secret of nuclear power policy that makes it so difficult to leave it, and not for reasons of energy policy at all.
As a rule, the path toward nuclear power always begins with so-called civilian nuclear programs.
For example, Iran's alleged civilian nuclear ambitions have led to a multitude of civilian programs in its neighbors.
A prankster who thinks evil!
And, of course, that is precisely why the so-called emerging economies are now closely watching and analyzing how the nuclear powers, in particular, will react to the Fukushima nuclear disaster.
How will the world, first and foremost the most important nuclear weapon states, react to the Fukushima nuclear disaster?
Will there be a real tidal shift globally, moving the world toward nuclear disarmament and a nuclear-weapon-free future?
Or will they try to explain away the reasons for this disaster in order to return to business as usual after some time?
Fukushima has presented the world with a far-reaching decision of principle.
It was Japan, the number one high-tech country (and not the late Soviet Union), that was unable to take the necessary precautions to prevent such a disaster in four reactor blocks.
But what will the future risk assessment have to look like when much less organised and developed states enter into the civilian use of nuclear energy with the active help of the nuclear powers?
And, of course, it will send a clear message to the secretive emerging powers with military intentions that while it is fine to talk about a nuclear-weapon-free future and write long documents, there is clearly a lack of political will on the part of the nuclear powers to make a real about-face on the international stage towards getting out of nuclear energy.
Such a step would not only mark an epochal change in the spirit of the times, but would also make an enormous contribution to global nuclear safety and would also be a decisive practical step in combating military nuclear proliferation.
Rebuilding the CAP
WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS - The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), introduced in 1957, is now more than 50 years old, and the European Commission intends to conduct what it calls a health check on its aging child.
However, superficial cosmetics will not be able to meet future requirements in the European Union.
The CAP needs to be re-created.
This should now be started and the project should be completed by 2013.
But a more fundamental rethink is needed.
The original aim of the CAP was to ensure food security for the six founding members of the Community, all of whom were dependent on food imports and striving for a degree of independence.
Good, healthy and inexpensive food had to be available to all citizens.
Improved agricultural productivity should benefit rural areas and provide farmers with an adequate share of the growing prosperity of the Community.
Tools have been developed to achieve these goals and food security has been achieved.
The CAP was soon seen as a jewel in the crown of the European project.
With the development and enlargement of the EU, food systems have become more complex, including production, processing, supply chain organisation, wholesale and retail distribution, with new health and environmental issues in all areas.
Soil use will also be subject to further scrutiny.
A 1991 study by the Dutch Scientific Council for Government Policy, Ground for Choices, showed that the EU's food supply could be achieved with 50% less arable land, 80% less pesticides, and 50% less pollution.
Environmental pollution would be reduced by 70 percent due to lower nitrate levels in surface water, and greenhouse gases would also be reduced.
These figures related to an EU of 15 members, so the possibilities are much greater today with 27 members.
A Dutch study of land use has shown that substantial increases in food production can be achieved by using the best technical and ecological means on the best available soil.
Not surprisingly, the number of farmers needed to produce food has fallen considerably.
From the perspective of food security and prosperity for rural areas, there is an urgent need to review the main instruments of the CAP in order to find a new political formula.
Perverse subsidies must be abolished and those that favour products such as bio-fuels reconsidered.
The status quo must change.
Rural policy in the EU is all too often limited to income guarantees for farmers.
But this attitude undermines change.
Competition must be encouraged, as rural entrepreneurship strengthens farmers, with fewer farmers, but better farms.
A simplified CAP would lead to a cleaner, more productive and more efficient agriculture.
A side benefit to the EU's international position would be that the impasse in the World Trade Organisation's Doha negotiations could resume as soon as farmers in developing countries were assured of being treated fairly by Europe.
Moreover, the CAP's role as an engine of political and social integration in Europe could be revived once revised policies are in place.
However, renewal of this kind cannot be left to international market forces, as the results may not necessarily be positive for European agriculture and society.
If the market behaves badly, farmers could slip into poverty, leading to neglect of much of Europe.
Policymakers must face up to this very real threat when they reform the CAP on the basis of the following five pillars.
1. The EU needs a policy of knowledge and innovation that strengthens the competitiveness of European agriculture.
Such a policy is successful in the Netherlands, where it contributes significantly to the development and performance of the agricultural industry.
Ten of the 21 sectors of the Dutch agricultural industry, such as horticultural seeds, ornamental plants, seed potatoes and veal, are among the largest sectors of the national economy and balance of trade in the country.
In the EU as a whole, a policy geared towards research programmes would promote scientific excellence and greater coherence in the European knowledge system, thus greatly strengthening the competitiveness of agriculture and contributing to food security and sustainable development.
2. Europe also needs a restructuring policy in the field of land use.
Numerous structural improvement programmes are financed at European level, but agricultural production and land use are not included.
The development of a basic agricultural structure would complement the basic European ecological structure.
Reforestation and damage remediation in natural ecosystems should also be part of a land use policy.
3. A policy in the area of European food systems would deal jointly with production, processing, distribution, logistics and sales.
Consumption patterns and preferences are an integral part of such systems.
Preliminary research by the European Science Foundation, entitled <unk> Forward Look on European Food Systems, could prove helpful in drawing up such an EU-wide policy.
4. In a rapidly urbanizing world, urban agriculture can produce high-quality products on small land areas.
This is a response to the growing demand for healthy food produced without major environmental impact.
5. A new CAP should also include a strategy to protect the countryside in Europe.
Cultural heritage should not be maintained everywhere, nor should costs be disregarded.
Moreover, it must not be a defensive strategy of the kind that tends to focus on low-quality land.
Boycott Against Reason
<unk>'s IAN LADYMAN runs the rule over a host of alarming hypothetical scenarios, and here, <unk> takes a closer look at the more pertinent question that has been asked recently in Britain, as universities across the UK have witnessed an all-too-real and disconcerting action.
In early June, NATFHE, the national association of lecturers in higher education, Britain's largest academic union with 67,000 members, filed a motion to sever ties with all Israeli professors and higher education institutions unless they publicly distanced themselves from Israel's continued apartheid policies.
The application was subsequently withdrawn, but the fact that it was made at all is astonishing enough.
In fact, the union's call for a blanket boycott violates its fundamental values: the principle of academic freedom, openness, and exchange; the protection of research from government policy; and the fundamental right to free speech.
The motion tacitly used collective punishment as a yardstick and struck a distinctly McCarthy-esque tone, with Israeli academics calling for some kind of "oath of disloyalty."
What led scholars, the supposed guardians of democratic freedoms, to adopt measures so reminiscent of fascist and Stalinist tactics?
Unfortunately, NATFHE's attempt is part of a larger phenomenon.
In 2005 AUT, the association of university lecturers, called for a more limited boycott and singled out the universities of Bar Ilan and Haifa as eyesores.
Before that, a petition signed by about 80 prominent British intellectuals and a few others from other European countries called for the European Union to stop funding Israeli cultural projects and institutions.
These campaigns, supported by Palestinian groups and non-governmental organisations, have been accompanied by individual professional campaigns of ostracism, and there is already an unofficial boycott of Israeli scholars, publications and cultural projects in some European circles.
Such developments point to a far-reaching and disturbing trend in which certain sections of European intellectuals are prepared to violate their own beliefs in order to cross-fire a state with a unique stigma, with insidious and sometimes illegal forms of discrimination against citizens of that state increasingly considered acceptable.
For people with a certain ideological outlook, Israel is not seen as a political entity judged by common standards, but as an almost symbolic power, the symbolic center and source of all the ills and problems in the world.
Of course, Israel is responsible for both bad politics and political sins.
The occupation of Palestinian territories has had terrible consequences and must end.
But in today's tense climate, the Middle East has become a kind of ideological projection screen, a magnet for tendencies toward demonization and idealization.
In the supposedly radical interpretation, the relationship between Israel and the Palestinians is rarely seen as a conflict between two groups with sometimes tragically conflicting interests.
Rather, the unruly complexity of the situation is reduced to a rigid struggle between absolute power and absolute powerlessness, the archetypal oppressor and archetypal oppressed.
The rhetoric directed at Israel is becoming increasingly extreme and leading to hatred.
Phrases such as "apartheid state" and "Zionism is racism" that were unthinkable in a liberal conversation a few years ago have become routine.
At the same time, the Palestinians are the subject of romanticized identification - one of the spokesmen for the NAFTA proposal was seen draped in a Palestinian flag before a meeting.
They are seen as the last pure good thing, the wholly innocent bystanders who are not responsible for their fate and who appear to have no political representation or choice.
The possibility that the Palestinians are capable of making conscious decisions, that their policies may have contributed to the current situation, or that they have exercised their own kind of power and violence, is never acknowledged in this context.
Hamas was not mentioned in any of the motions put forward by the university unions.
This is left-wing Manichaeism, and just like the Manichaeism of the political right, it can distort reality to the point of breaking away from reality.
In any case, the boycott ignored basic facts.
If British academics are not ill-informed, they know that Israel, far from being an apartheid state, has a large Arab population, that Israeli universities are well-integrated, in some cases with significant numbers of Arab students and some admittedly small and under-represented Arab faculty, that many universities sponsor joint projects with Palestinian and Arab counterparts, that they are often a place of resistance to government policies, and that such opposition, even in a radical form, is tolerated.
Advocates of discriminatory measures often cite stifling and legitimate criticism of Israel against their opponents.
This argument is both insidious and dishonest.
Many critics of the boycott are also critical of Israel.
But credible criticism must be based on evidence and generally applicable assessment criteria.
If the British trade unions wanted to be morally consistent, they would have to apply the same policies to universities in many countries where human rights are brutally violated and freedom of speech suppressed.
Some see this hostility to Israel as veiled, old-fashioned anti-Semitism.
It is always risky to speculate on hidden motives, but the systematic denigration of Israeli society and culture undoubtedly fosters the feeling that anti-Semitism is also a permissible prejudice.
It is always easier to view a group or nation as the malevolent other when that impulse is fuelled by an old, still-strong prejudice.
But something more fundamental is at stake.
Democratic societies depend not only on the fundamental principle of freedom of speech, but also on the nature of political thought and dialogue between different societies.
When the supposedly most enlightened and liberal of these circles engage in narrow-minded discussions and resort to intolerant measures, the tendency towards fanaticism and ideological irrationality is reinforced.
The actions of the British Academics "Union have Israel as a clear target.
But the main effect could be to undermine sensible debate and civil behavior, without which democracy is powerless to confront the forces of polarization and extremism.
A Breakthrough Against Hunger
NEW YORK - The current hunger crisis has reached unprecedented proportions and needs urgent action.
Nearly a billion people are trapped in the famine trap, about 100 million more than two years ago.
Spain is now taking the global lead in the fight against hunger. Leaders from all over the world have been invited to Madrid at the end of January to go beyond fine words and take concrete action.
Led by Spain and in partnership with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, several donor countries are proposing to pool their financial resources so that the world's poorest farmers can grow more food and thus escape poverty.
The benefits of this aid from donor countries can be considerable.
Smallholder farmers in Africa, Haiti, and other impoverished regions are currently growing their crops without the benefits of higher-yielding seeds and fertilizers.
As a result, crop yields (maize, for example) are about a third lower.
African farmers produce about one ton of grain per hectare, compared to more than four tons per hectare in China, which relies heavily on fertilizer.
African farmers know that they need fertilizer, but they cannot afford it.
Donor aid would make this possible.
These farmers can then not only feed their families, but also earn a market income and save for the future.
These savings, built up over a few years, will eventually make farmers creditworthy or have enough cash to buy much-needed products themselves.
There is broad agreement on the need for increased financial support for smallholder farmers, particularly in Africa (those with two hectares or less of land and impoverished livestock farmers).
The U.N. secretary-general last year chaired a steering committee that found that agriculture in Africa needs about $8 billion a year in funding, about four times the amount currently available, with a focus on improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems and agricultural advice.
In addition to direct aid to smallholder farmers, donor countries should provide more funding for research and development needed to develop new seed varieties for higher yields and to breed crops that can withstand temporary floods, excess nitrogen, salty soils and pests, as well as other challenges of sustainable food production.
Helping the poor with current technology, while investing in improving it in the future, is the best way to cooperate.
Research centers like the International Rice Research Institute and the International Center for the Improvement of Corn and Wheat are developing high-yielding seeds and innovative agricultural strategies that together are driving Asia's green revolution.
These centres are not yet known to the general public, but they should be.
The scientific breakthroughs there have helped feed the world, and we need more of these centers.
Dozens of some 40 to 50 low-income countries with food shortages have developed emergency programs to improve food production by smallholder farmers, but are currently unable to implement them due to lack of funding.
These countries turned to the World Bank, which made a valiant effort in 2008 in the form of the new Global Food Crisis Response Program.
But the World Bank does not have the resources to meet these countries "urgent needs, so aid had to be reduced to a few measures that could be used effectively and reliably.
Meanwhile, hundreds of millions of people remain trapped in a hunger trap.
Many individual donor countries said that they were now ready to increase financial aid to small farmers, but that they had not found the mechanisms to do so.
The current support structures are not sufficient.
The more than 20 bilateral and multilateral donor institutions in the field of agriculture are highly fragmented and inadequate both individually and collectively.
Despite the dedicated efforts of many experts, the response to the hunger crisis remains profoundly inadequate.
The 2008 growing season came and went without sufficient additional aid being made available to the impoverished smallholder farmers.
African countries are endlessly, and mostly unsuccessfully, looking for the modest amounts of money they need to buy fertilizer and improved seeds.
My colleagues and I who sit on the advisory committee of the Spanish initiative recommend that donor countries deposit their funds into a single international account, which we call the Financial Coordination Mechanism (FCM).
These funds allow farmers in poor countries to buy fertilizer, improved seeds, and much-needed small-scale irrigation systems.
Poor countries would receive rapid and reliable financing for agricultural aid from a single fund, not dozens of different donors.
By pooling financial resources in one FCM, it is possible to keep the administrative costs of aid programs low and ensure the availability of funds. Moreover, poor countries would not have to negotiate 25 times before receiving aid.
The time of normal operation is over.
Donor countries have pledged to double aid to Africa by 2010, but are still well below their pledges.
In reality, aid for agricultural programmes has been cut over the last 20 years and only now is there a change of direction.
Meanwhile, a billion people are starving every day.
We need a demonstrable, public, clear and convincing breakthrough that mobilises people's hearts and minds and demonstrates success.
History can be made in Madrid at the end of January, when the world's richest and poorest countries come together to find solutions to the global hunger crisis.
The lives of the poorest billion people depend on it.
A unique opportunity for global health
NEW YORK - Millions of people die each year from preventable and treatable diseases, especially in poor countries.
In many cases, life-saving drugs can be mass-produced cheaply, but their sale price is so high that it blocks access for those who need them.
And many people die because there is no treatment for their disease or vaccines, because only a small proportion of valuable research and resources are devoted to the diseases of the poor.
This situation is a failure of the economy and the law, which urgently needs to be rectified.
The good news is that there are now new opportunities for change, most promising of which is a World Health Organization initiative to correct the inadequate intellectual property regime that impedes the development and availability of cheap medicines.
The availability of medicines today is limited due to two major problems.
Firstly, medicines are very expensive; or, more precisely, the price charged for them is very high, even though the cost of production is only a fraction of that amount.
Second, drug development is geared to maximizing profits, not social benefits, which distorts efforts to develop medicines that are central to people's well-being.
Because the poor have so little money at their disposal, drug manufacturers have little incentive, under current conditions, to devote themselves to research into diseases that affect the poor.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Pharmaceutical companies argue that high prices are needed to fund research and development.
In the United States, however, the government actually funds the bulk of health research and development, either directly through public assistance (the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation) or indirectly through purchases of drugs for Medicare and Medicaid health programs.
But not even the non-government part is a conventional market, because most of the cost of prescription drugs is covered by insurance.
The state funds health research because improved medicines are a public good.
All benefit from the knowledge gained from this research, by containing epidemics and limiting the economic and human costs of widespread diseases.
Efficiency requires the broadest possible sharing of research results as soon as they become available.
Thomas Jefferson likened knowledge to candles: even if the flame of one candle lights another candle, its own light does not burn weaker.
On the contrary, everything is getting brighter.
And yet, in America and most of the world, drug prices are still exorbitantly high and the dissemination of knowledge is tightly limited.
This is because we have created a patent system that gives innovators a temporary monopoly over their work, which in turn encourages them to keep their knowledge under wraps so as not to help their competitors.
While this system provides incentives for some types of research because it makes innovation profitable, it also allows pharmaceutical companies to raise prices and incentives do not necessarily correspond to social returns.
In the health sector, it may be more profitable to focus on research into an analogous drug than on developing a treatment that makes a real difference.
The patent system can even have a detrimental effect on innovation, because it promotes secrecy, while the most important contribution to any kind of research consists of previous ideas.
One solution to the problems of high prices and misguided research is to replace the current model with a state-supported price fund.
Such a pricing system rewards innovators for new knowledge, but does not give them a monopoly on the use of that knowledge.
In this way, competition on the markets can ensure that a medicine is available at the lowest possible price, rather than at an excessive monopoly price, once it has been developed.
Fortunately, some American Members are very interested in this approach.
The bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, the Fund for HIV / AIDS Act, is not just an initiative.
It also contains important provisions with regard to the promotion of open source research, in order to shift the focus of the current research model from secrecy to the sharing of knowledge.
Globally, however, our innovation system needs far more profound changes.
The WTO's efforts to achieve broad reforms at international level are crucial.
This spring, the WHO published a report recommending solutions similar to those proposed in the US bill at the international level.
The report, entitled "Research and Development to Meet Health Needs in Developing Countries," advocates a comprehensive approach, including mandatory financial contributions from states for health-care research in developing countries; international coordination of health-care priorities and their implementation; and a global monitoring body that identifies where the need is greatest.
At the end of May, the international community will have a chance to put these ideas into practice at the WHO's World Health Assembly, a moment of hope for public health around the world.
Reform of our innovation system is not just a matter of economics, but in many cases of life and death.
It is therefore essential to decouple R & D incentives from drug prices and to promote improved sharing of scientific knowledge.
For America, the Sanders bill marks significant progress.
For the whole world, the WHO's recommendations represent a rare and unique opportunity to put an end to long-standing and bottomless injustices in health care and, more generally, to develop a regime for global public goods that responds to the age of globalization.
No Euro without central (control) control
CAMBRIDGE - With youth unemployment near 50 percent in eurozone countries such as Spain and Greece, one wonders if this is sacrificing a generation in favor of a single currency whose member countries are simply too diverse to form a viable monetary union.
If so, it begs the question of whether enlargement of the eurozone actually serves Europe's obvious goal of maximizing economic integration without necessarily pursuing full political union.
The good news is that economic research can say something about whether Europe should have a single currency.
The bad news is that it has become increasingly clear that currency areas, at least for large countries, are highly unstable unless they follow national boundaries.
A minimum requirement for a monetary union is a confederation of states with far more centralized powers over tax collection and other powers than European leaders plan for the eurozone.
What does this mean with regard to the famous hypothesis, formulated in 1961 by the Nobel laureate economist Robert Mundell, according to which national boundaries and the boundaries of a currency area need not necessarily overlap?
In his controversial paper, The Theory of Optimal Currency Areas, published in the American Economic Review, Mundell argues that such a space could afford to abandon the compensatory mechanisms of exchange rate adjustment as long as workers within a currency area could move freely to where there was work.
He praised another (later) Nobel laureate, James Meade, for highlighting the importance of labour mobility in previous work, but also criticised Mundell for interpreting the idea too strictly, particularly in the context of Europe's nascent integration.
Mundell did not focus on financial crises, but labor mobility is probably more important today than ever.
Not surprisingly, workers are leaving the crisis-hit eurozone countries, but not necessarily toward the stronger countries in the north.
Rather, it attracts Portuguese workers to booming former colonies such as Brazil and Macao.
Irish workers are leaving their homes in droves for Canada, Australia, and the United States, and Spanish workers are now flocking to Romania, from where, until recently, many workers employed in Spanish agriculture came.
Nevertheless, if labor mobility were anywhere near the ideal described by Mundell, we would not have an unemployment rate of 25% in Spain today, while it is less than 7% in Germany.
Later, other economists recognized that there are other critical criteria for a successful monetary union, but they are difficult to achieve without deep political union.
Peter Kenen argued in the late 1960 "s that a monetary union without the shock-absorbing effect of exchange-rate fluctuations would require fiscal transfers to share risk.
In a normal country, the national payroll and income tax system is a huge automatic stabilizer within the country's regions. In the US, rising oil prices raise incomes in Texas and Montana.
This means that these states contribute more tax revenue to the federal budget, thereby helping out the rest of the country. & Europe does not have a central tax authority, so this crucial automatic stabilizer is essentially absent.
Some European scholars have tried to argue that there is no need for American-style fiscal transfers, because any desired degree of risk-sharing can theoretically be achieved through financial markets.
This approach was grossly misguided.
Financial markets can be fragile, and they have little risk-sharing capacity in terms of labor income, which is the largest source of income in any advanced economy.
Kenen's main aim was to smooth out cyclical bumps in the road with short-term transfers.
But, in a monetary union with large differences in income and level of development, short-termism can last a very long time.
Many Germans today rightly feel that any system of fiscal transfers will turn into a permanent supply line along the lines of northern Italy, which has provided financial support to southern Italy for a century.
Indeed, even after more than 20 years, West Germany still does not see an end to payments for German reunification.
Later, Maurice Obstfeld pointed out that, in addition to fiscal transfers, a monetary union requires clearly defined rules for the lender of last resort.
Otherwise, bank runs and debt panic would spread.
Obstfeld had in mind rescue mechanisms for banks, but it is now clear to everyone that a lender of last resort and a bankruptcy mechanism for states and municipalities are also needed.
A corollary of the criteria outlined by Kenen and Obstfeld, as well as Mundell's criterion of labor mobility, is that a monetary union cannot exist without political legitimacy, including cross-regional elections.
European leaders will not be able to sustain huge transfers between countries indefinitely without a coherent policy framework in Europe.
Today, European policymakers often complain that the eurozone would be doing well had it not been for the US financial crisis.
Maybe they're right.
But any financial system must be able to cope with shocks of a larger magnitude.
Europe may never become a fully-fledged currency area.
But without further deep political and economic integration - which may not include all current eurozone members - the euro could not even make it to the end of this decade.
A Chinese champion for peace and freedom
PRAGUE - On Christmas Day last year, one of China's best-known human rights activists, writer and university professor Liu Xiaobo, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for being one of the main authors of Charter 08, a petition inspired by Charter 77 that calls on the Chinese government to abide by its own laws and constitution, as well as calling for the open election of state officials, religious freedom, freedom of expression and the abolition of laws against the erosion of state power.
For his courage and clarity of thought about China's future, Liu deserves the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. There are two reasons why we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of this prestigious award.
First and foremost, he follows in the tradition of Nobel Peace Prize laureates who have been honored for their contribution to the struggle for human rights. Nobel laureates such as Martin Luther King, Lech Walesa, and Aung San Suu Kyi are just a few of many examples that the Nobel Committee has honored in previous years.
We believe that the ideas put to paper by Liu and his colleagues in December 2008 are both universal and timeless, and that these ideals - respect for human rights and human dignity, and the responsibility of citizens to ensure that their governments respect those rights - represent humanity's highest aspiration.
If the Nobel Committee decides to recognize Liu's courage and sacrifice in standing up for these ideals, it would not only draw the world's attention to the injustice of Liu's 11-year sentence; it would also help to strengthen the universal and humanist values for which Liu has spent much of his life within China.
The second reason why Liu deserves the Nobel Peace Prize is consistent with Alfred Nobel's original intention for the award. Through his work promoting human rights, political reform, and democratization in China, Liu has contributed significantly to the values of peace and brotherhood among nations that Nobel thought of when he established the prize more than 100 years ago.
Of course, democratization does not automatically guarantee better behavior on the world stage. However, it enables a broad and rigorous debate on key foreign and domestic policy issues of a state. This active and searching conversation, the hallmark of a democratic form of government, represents the best hope for better decisions by governments, both at home and abroad.
Liu's commitment to democracy in China is above all about the well-being of the Chinese people. But his courage and example could help hasten the day when China's involvement in international affairs is supported by the expertise and control of civil-society groups, independent media, and engaged citizens who can express their views at the ballot box.
For these two reasons above all, we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. By bestowing one of the greatest honours in the world on Liu, the Committee would once again emphasise the importance of human rights and democracy on the one hand, and that of world peace and international solidarity on the other.
Liu's harsh prison sentence should set an example and be a strong warning to all other Chinese who may want to follow him on his path. We are convinced that there are moments when exemplary social commitment like Liu's requires an exemplary response. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize is exactly the answer that his courage deserves.
A climate change agreement is not enough
AMSTERDAM - World leaders are negotiating the future of the planet at the COP 15 climate summit in Copenhagen.
All the indications are that there is unlikely to be a global climate agreement.
The views of the participating countries and of the various industrial and political power blocs are simply too far apart.
Politicians, civil servants and the other participants in the Copenhagen Summit have mainly bombarded each other with figures showing by how much different countries can reduce their CO2 emissions, what sums will have to be allocated in the next few years, exactly how the areas of responsibility are defined, how high the barely tolerable temperature increase can be and how long we can wait.
These are very important issues.
But numbers alone are simply not enough.
A different approach is needed to combat climate change.
The climate problem can only be solved on the basis of common, deeply felt ethical principles.
Humanity has reached a critical point in world history where peoples and nations must show solidarity with each other and with the Earth and take action.
In the same way that world leaders adopted the UN Millennium Declaration in September 2000 and committed themselves to the resulting Millennium Development Goals, today's climate negotiators must commit themselves to creating a basis of common fundamental ethical principles.
It is not difficult to find this basis.
The Earth Charter, launched in 2000 and initiated by former Soviet presidents Mikhail Gorbachev and Wangari Mathaai, among others, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004 for its involvement in the pan-African Green Belt reforestation initiative.
The climate problem knows no national boundaries.
Over the next few decades, low-lying countries like the Netherlands will have to invest billions of euros to step up their age-old fight against rising sea levels.
In many other countries, however, the dykes are already being flooded, both literally and figuratively.
Climate change mainly affects countries that lack the financial resources to take adequate action against rising sea levels, prolonged droughts or devastating storms, even though they have nothing to do with the root cause of these problems - industrialization in developed countries.
Apart from the necessary, often infrastructural adjustments to the effects of climate change, huge efforts are needed to prevent even worse.
Major investment is needed in afforestation, agriculture and energy supply.
In devising solutions, the focus should be on the role of women.
Women are often the first to address the problem of access to natural resources, and they are able to play an important role as pioneers in devising solutions to the problem of climate change and how humanity should adapt to it.
In the short term, the world should become a sustainable, low-carbon global society.
This is a mission for all of humanity, and patriotic sentiments and power bloc thinking should have no place.
Huge efforts are needed to achieve the goal of a sustainable, low-carbon global society.
It is precisely for this reason that we also need a far-reaching common ethical basis.
This would put the negotiating parties on a path where they seek not only solutions to partial problems but, first and foremost, a comprehensive solution to the overall problem.
Climate change is too important to be left to politicians.
In Copenhagen, it is therefore essential that not only states, but also business and citizens join forces to save the climate.
This is not only a scientifically based necessity, but an ethical imperative.
The chemistry of our morals
OXFORD In Anthony Burgess's novella A Clockwork Orange (and Stanley Kubrick's adaptation), Alex, an unrepentant psychopath, is prevented by a device from closing his eyes and forced to watch violent films.
Like a Pavlovian dog, Alex is conditioned to react with nausea to violence and sex.
This scene remains shocking, but, as is so often the case in science fiction, it has aged.
The behavioural psychology on which it is based is long out of date, and the fear that science will be used to improve society's morale, perhaps even by force, no longer seems relevant today.
Science fiction is ageing fast, but it has a long afterlife.
Over the past decade, an army of psychologists, neuroscientists and evolutionary biologists have been busy trying to uncover the neural clockwork that underlies human morality.
Researchers have begun to trace the evolutionary origins of pro-social feelings, such as empathy, and have begun to identify the genes that cause some individuals to engage in senseless violence and others in altruistic behavior, as well as the pathways in our brains that shape our ethical decisions.
Once you begin to understand how something works, there are ways to change and even control it.
In fact, scientists have identified not only some of the pathways in the brain that shape our ethical decisions, but also chemical substances that regulate these neuronal activities.
A recent study has shown that the antidepressant citalopram can alter the reactions of people in a hypothetical moral dilemma.
Subjects who received the drug showed less willingness to sacrifice one person's life in order to save the lives of several others.
Another series of studies has shown that the hormone oxytocin, when administered by nasal spray, promotes trust and cooperation within social groups, but also reduces cooperation with those perceived as outsiders.
Neuroscientists have even magnetically charged carefully selected areas of the brain of subjects and influenced their moral judgments in surprising ways, such as making it easier for them to lie.
Of course, no one is developing a moral pill that will turn us into saints.
However, research is making rapid progress and is likely to reveal new ways of reshaping our moral intuitions, feelings and motivations.
Should we use our growing scientific understanding of the basis of human morality to try to influence people morally positively?
A Clockwork Orange has been accused of glorifying violence and some of the scenes are still hard to watch.
But, as Burgess himself argued, the novella has an almost Christian message: what makes us human is our freedom to choose between good and evil, and it is as bad, or perhaps worse, for society to force individuals into submissive conformity as the sadism of psychopaths like Alex.
I suspect that many will share this view.
You will agree that our ability to distinguish right from wrong is something precious to protect, not a broken clock that scientists should fix.
Most of us, of course, do not have to be conditioned to react with revulsion to rape or torture.
But that does not mean that we are morally good or good enough.
As you read this, ordinary people somewhere in the world are doing unspeakable things to others.
Even in the most modern and prosperous societies, a huge purposeful effort is required to preserve even the slightest decency: think of castles, alarms, police, courts, and prisons.
And it is questionable whether we really make enough of others or give enough to the less fortunate.
People are born with the capacity for morality, but that capacity is limited and ill-equipped to deal with the ethical complexities of the modern world.
For millennia, man has relied on education, conviction, social institutions, and the threat of real (or supernatural) punishment to ensure decent behavior.
We could all be better morally, but it is clear that we will not make much progress with this traditional approach.
After all, people wouldn't suddenly start behaving better if we just gave them more facts and statistics or better arguments.
So we shouldn't be too quick to dismiss the suggestion that science can help, first by helping us develop more effective institutions, more inspiring moral education, or more compelling ethical arguments.
But science could also show more direct ways to influence our brains.
Sometimes science fiction limits rather than expands our sense of what is possible.
Trying to promote morality through brutal coercion would do the opposite of what is desired, or worse.
Governments should not be given the power to control the moral code of their citizens - we know they would abuse that power if they had it.
Ideally, individuals would be free to explore various avenues of personal improvement, whether by practicing mindfulness, reading moral philosophy or, yes, taking a moral pill.
Although some people are eager to take pills that make them feel better or think faster, it is not so clear that people really want to take pills that have a morally beneficial effect on them.
It is not clear that people really want to be morally better.
And those who need the most help, such as psychopath Alex, are likely to be the ones who least want it.
These considerations are, of course, hypothetical.
We do not yet know what will be possible.
Nevertheless, we should start the ethical discussion too early rather than too late.
And while moral pills are only science fiction, they raise profound questions.
Will we want to take them if they ever exist?
And what does it say about us if we don't want to?
A cloud over aircraft safety
PRINCETON - When European airports that were closed because of the eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull volcano reopened, it was not because there was less ash in the atmosphere, but because the risk that ash poses to aircraft safety has been reassessed.
Was it new scientific information that led to the lifting of the ban, or was it a reflection of the personal and economic difficulties caused by the ban?
In six days, about 95,000 flights have been canceled, costing airlines more than $1 billion.
An estimated five million passengers were stranded or facing delays.
The UK economy has lost £1.5 billion, while others have been similarly affected.
Flower growers in Kenya, who depend on their short-lived cargo to reach Europe by plane, suddenly found themselves without income.
Sixteen cancer patients who rely on vital bone marrow for transplants were put at risk because the right bone marrow could not be flown in from the United States or Canada.
Past incidents in which jets have flown through volcanic ash in the US, Indonesia, the Philippines and Mexico have resulted in temporary engine failures, and in one case a plane has lost several thousand metres of altitude, but all have landed safely.
But there was no evidence that the more scattered ash that wafted across from Iceland to Europe would cause similar problems.
The decision to impose flight bans was based on the view that any amount of ash in the atmosphere poses a risk to aircraft and that it is the government's job, however small, to ensure that safety comes first, as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown put it.
By closing their airspace, European governments seem to have given absolute priority to safety above all else.
And yet no government acts on this principle in other areas.
Every day, around 3,000 people die on the roads worldwide.
Limiting speed to, say, 10 kilometres per hour would prevent most accidents and save many lives.
We do not do so because we give safety a lower priority than our desire to spend less time driving.
The price we are prepared to pay for security cannot be infinitely high.
It is distasteful to put a price on a human life, but the more we spend on security, the less we will have for our other goals.
The UK government uses a figure of just over £1 million as the overall maximum amount it is prepared to pay to save a statistical life, such as by improving road safety.
In the U.S., the Department of Transportation is willing to spend $5.8 million on the same purpose, nearly four times the current exchange rate.
Does this mean that security is a priority in the US but not in the UK?
Giovanni Bisignani, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), an industry body, criticised the closures and said no risk assessment had been carried out.
Overall, however, the public seemed to back the decision.
Stranded travellers interviewed at airports usually said they would rather be stuck at the airport than on a plane falling from the sky.
What if some travelers have a higher risk tolerance or simply need to move more urgently than others?
John Stuart Mill, in his classic On Freedom, considered a situation where a man is about to cross a bridge that we know is unsafe.
From Mill's point of view, our intervention is only justified to ensure that he is aware of the danger.
Once he knows that, it is up to him to make a decision, because only he can assess the importance of his journey and weigh it against the risk he is taking.
The situation with air safety is somewhat different, as a crashing plane can kill people on the ground, but by far the greatest risk is borne by passengers and crew.
If they are fully aware of the risks and still want to fly, and the crew may have been offered more money, as is often the case with people in dangerous professions, should we prevent them from choosing to fly?
After test flights without passengers on board showed no engine damage and aircraft engine manufacturers informed aviation authorities that their engines were operating safely with a small amount of ash in the atmosphere, European airspace was finally reopened.
The International Civil Aviation Organization has announced that it will convene a panel of experts to help it provide industry standards to determine the value of ash in the atmosphere that poses a threat to aviation safety.
Now that we have seen how much it costs to put safety first, we know that this is not a purely technical issue.
I trust that among the experts there were some who were thinking about the underlying ethical question: how safe do we want to be?
Communist Party without Communism
PRINCETON - Russian President Vladimir Putin's anointing of Alexander Medvedev as his successor in an ostensibly democratic election shows that Russia's leaders have not changed one iota.
It seems increasingly likely that we will hear the same names in the news for decades to come, as we did under Leonid Brezhnev.
According to Gleb Pavlovsky, the Putin regime's leading ideologue, the current Russian system is perfect in every sense except one: it doesn't know its enemies.
Indeed, it seems that everyone in the Kremlin is now reading the National Socialist legal theorist Carl Schmitt, who taught that the central mission of politics is to name its enemies.
In Schmitt's spirit, Putin's men have designated a liberal party, the Union of Right Forces, as their primary enemy.
The party's public meetings were dispersed by armed police, its leaders arrested and beaten, and Putin himself described its supporters as "coyotes."
What is surprising is that this aggressive behavior does not respond to any discernible danger: oil prices are soaring, as are Putin's poll ratings.
The people he appoints control everything that matters, from Gazprom to the Central Electoral Committee.
No credible force can seriously challenge Putin's men since the pacification of Chechnya through violence and subsidies, the imprisonment or emigration of the few financially serious opponents, and the massive social investment in recent years that has bribed the population under Medvedev's personal watch.
But their regime is in crisis, and they know it.
Russia's economy is more dependent on gas and oil than ever before.
Military reform has been put on hold.
Despite rising incomes, Russians "education and health are worse today than when Putin came to power, and they are still dying at shockingly young ages.
Russia's involvement in world affairs is tainted by the stain of poison and corruption.
State monopolies are destroying what private companies have built up.
Endowed with more money, uneducated bureaucrats hire even more uneducated bureaucrats; the result is that the regime fails to govern the country.
The country is renitent, and its rulers know it.
That's why they panic.
Putin's goal was to bring all power under the control of Russia's security forces.
The KGB officers of his generation had witnessed the collapse of the Communist Party and all the government bodies it directed and controlled, including the KGB.
Under Putin, the security service got its revenge.
His staff became powerful, arrogant and enormously rich.
And they were disobedient.
In 2004, General Viktor Cherkesov, then Putin's representative in northwestern Russia, published an essay glorifying the KGB as the only untainted authority in a corrupt country.
This essay defined Putin's second term more than anything else.
In October 2007, Cherkesov (now head of one of Russia's most opaque and powerful services, the Drug Enforcement Administration) published another essay lamenting the degeneration of his colleagues: warriors, he complained, had turned into dealers.
Earlier, generals from a rival intelligence agency, the FSB, had arrested Cherkesov's deputy for illegal wiretapping.
In a public gesture of desperation, Cherkesov acknowledged the failure of Putin's project to revive Russian leadership by subordinating it to the secret services.
Cherkesov's deputy remains in prison.
Most observers believe that Putin is incapable of intervening in his defense.
Freed from Communist Party control, the security officers have betrayed their corporate ethics and engaged in dubious business, using force when a business is not going their way.
It was clear that this is happening to ordinary Russians; Cherkesov revealed that the Putin circle is also affected by this situation.
What can be done when former KGB warriors attack each other with swords and bugs?
The Cherkesov case epitomises Putin's nightmare.
But when your instincts let you down, you fall back on deeper ones.
Now that Putin's people have left behind the neoliberal ideas of their predecessors and lost their illusions about the ex-KGB clique, they see it as their task to create an omnipresent political party that controls the security services, the administration, businesses, and more.
This party will be centralised under personal leadership, reducing the state to the level of legal fiction.
Their nationalist managers will believe in their universal competence rather than KGB-style professionalism and corporatism.
Boris Yeltsin once issued a decree banning party cells in state-controlled institutions.
Putin's legal advisers will reverse that decision; the party will have cells or committees in every factory, every company, every military unit, every university department, and so on.
Unified by their leader's charisma and party discipline, party members will steer and unite the devastated country.
So much for Putin's plan.
Like former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, the only other KGB man to rule Russia, Putin will become the party's general secretary.
As in the Soviet era, state and government officials will be downgraded to mere party cliches - the role that President Medvedev will play under Mr Putin.
And, of course, the office of Secretary-General is not bound by a constitutional limitation on the term of office.
Ultimately, Putin has what history left him: no ideas, only a grouping that seeks to consolidate its power.
Lenin and Trotsky needed a party to implement their ideology;
Putin and Medvedev are devising an ideology to consolidate their party.
It's a bizarre ideology.
It accuses warriors of being traders and traders of being thieves, while shunning its Marxist origins.
It will subject all who really work - merchants, warriors, journalists and others - to the party ideologues whose sole job is to look for enemies.
The Union of States as a Solution for Palestine
LONDON When I was in New York last month, I happened to be staying in the same hotel as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
To ensure its safety, the hotel had been turned into a fortress, just like Israel itself.
Netanyahu was in the United States to participate in another round of Middle East peace talks.
The US offered various incentives to get Israel to suspend construction in the West Bank for another 90 days.
The Israelis refused. Once again, they had reached an impasse.
What are the chances of a peaceful negotiated settlement between the two peoples, who both claim the same country?
The answer is: very bad.
All peace efforts since the Oslo Accords of 1993 have been based on a two-state solution that requires Israel to cede the occupied territories to a Palestinian state, the Palestinians to abandon their claims to the Jewish state, and everyone to live happily ever after.
The official Western doctrine remains "land for peace."
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a recent speech that a "just, lasting and comprehensive peace must be based on two states for two peoples."
Meanwhile, the two main parties to the conflict, Palestine and Israel, are looking for unilateral alternatives to the impasse in the peace process.
The Palestinians are pushing for international recognition as a state, while the Israelis are using their settlement policies to pre-empt a Palestinian state.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas says he will push for UN recognition of the Palestinian state within the 1967 borders if current peace talks fail.
This month, Brazil and Argentina recognized Palestine, and a number of other Latin American countries are expected to follow suit.
Abbas now looks to Europe and would ask Turkey to act as a mediator.
Its goal is to push the US to withdraw its near-unconditional support for Israeli policies through international recognition of a Palestinian state.
Israel's main concern remains security.
The official Western doctrine is that Israel's long-term security depends on the success of the peace process.
In practice, Israel is taking other measures to secure its future.
Media attention has been focused on <unk>'s security wall, which has certainly managed to reduce the level of violence.
But for the hawks who now dominate Israeli politics, the depth of defense is the key to Israel's security, and expansion of settlements is indispensable.
The hawks "recipe for survival consists of three elements: continued US military and economic support, defensible borders owing to a strategic settlement program, and the fragmentation of the Palestinian West Bank into isolated Bantustans, or subordinate administrative units incapable of concerted opposition to Israeli policies.
So while Abbas is trying to create new realities by rallying international support for a Palestinian state, Israel wants to oust him by rendering such a state unviable in advance.
The ideal alternative to both strategies is a peace process aimed not at creating two states, but at establishing a political and economic basis for a confederation of states.
In fact, the two-state solution has always been an illusion.
There was never enough land to satisfy the passionate greed of all those who made claims.
And in time, a withdrawal of settlers from the West Bank and East Jerusalem became as impossible as any attempt by Israel to expel the remaining Arabs.
Israeli Jews are likely to remain in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Israeli Arabs in Israel.
These are the facts that destroy Palestinian hopes for a sovereign Palestinian state, as well as Israeli hopes for an all-Jewish state.
Moreover, the concept of land for peace never made any economic sense at all.
If compensation for the Palestinians should have been the guiding principle, there would always have been better choices than establishing a fragile, poverty-stricken, foreign-aid-dependent state.
Most people have forgotten that the Paris Protocol of April 1994 established a customs union between Israel and the Occupied Territories, in which a joint economic council judges trade disputes.
The free movement of goods, labor, and capital between the two parts of the country could have given a huge boost to Palestinian GDP.
Likewise, this would have been a basis for a confederation of states, the Palestinian part of which would have benefited from the productivity and tax payments of settlers in the West Bank.
But these friendly prospects were undermined by the violence needed to sustain the Jewish state and enable the emergence of a Palestinian one.
The official view remains that only an internationally guaranteed two-state solution can provide the security necessary for the economic revival of the Palestinian territories.
But it is also possible that Israel's unilateral policy, implicitly supported by the US, will create a temporary peace sufficient to generate economic growth that will cool Palestinian nationalism. Palestine is not the overriding concern, even in Arab states.
That is why Netanyahu's strategy of deep defense has a better chance of succeeding than Abbas's push for statehood based on international recognition.
Netanyahu's project is not moral.
A Union of States for Kosovo
Time is running out in Kosovo.
Unless a United Nations-backed deal is reached by early December, the province's Albanian majority is likely to declare independence unilaterally, a move the US has already said it may support.
That would be catastrophic.
Russia would be outraged, fearing that secession from Kosovo, internationally recognised or not, could fuel separatist movements in the former Soviet empire.
The rejection in Serbia is even stronger.
Serbian Secretary of State for Kosovo Dusan Prorokovic has stated that his country could possibly use force to maintain its sovereignty.
Even if the government shied away, ultranationalist groups could push Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to send troops; the current U.N. presence in Kosovo is weak (just 40 military observers and 2,116 police), but the deployment of 15,000 NATO troops could make an armed clash extremely dangerous.
After eight years of international administration, Kosovo's Albanian majority has tasted freedom and is now striving for full independence.
Serbia, however, claims that the province is an indispensable part of its historical and cultural tradition.
Moreover, the Serbian public would not accept this independence, having already watched with dismay the gradual dismantling of Greater Serbia, most recently when it broke away from Montenegro.
Serbia only wants to give Kosovo greater autonomy and powers to conclude international agreements.
Although the two parties now seem irreconcilable, it is not too late to reach a compromise.
But this can only be achieved by revitalising and modernising an old institution of the international community, the Confederation of States.
Under a binding UN Security Council resolution, Kosovo could be given full and exclusive authority over its citizens and territory, as well as limited authority to act on the international stage.
Kosovo could be granted the right to enter into trade agreements and agreements with regard to individuals (for example, the reception and movement of foreigners or their expulsion), as well as the right to apply for membership of the UN (which does not require full sovereignty and independence).
Kosovo would thus be granted essential outward signs of a state.
But a decision-making body consisting of delegates from Kosovo, Serbia, and the European Union would have absolute decision-making power over foreign policy (for example, alliances and relations with international economic institutions), defense, borders (should Kosovo wish to join Albania), and the treatment of Kosovo's Serb minority.
Thus Kosovo and Serbia would be two different international subjects within a confederation of states, which in turn would be subject to a joint decision-making body.
Of course, that confederation would be asymmetrical, as the Serbian government's sovereignty over the rest of Serbia would remain intact and unrestricted, while the Kosovar government's sovereignty over Kosovo would be limited.
In order to prevent one of the two parties from gaining the upper hand over the other and taking arbitrary decisions, the joint decision-making body should consist of four Serbian and two Kosovar delegates, as well as three EU representatives, so that both sides must endeavour to secure the support of the EU delegates.
In addition, the EU should form a small but effective military intervention force (around 5,000 troops) to support the decisions of the Joint Body.
As with any compromise, both parties would win and lose.
Serbia would save face and retain a significant say on key issues in Kosovo, including the treatment of the Serb minority.
Kosovo would gain limited independence and move from the province of a sovereign state to an international entity empowered to enter into certain agreements with other states and even to become a member of the UN.
This contribution to stabilising a highly fragile region would also benefit the EU.
It would monitor Kosovo and prevent any conflict that could turn violent.
A final advantage of this solution would be its temporary character.
Historically, federations of states will sooner or later become federal states (such as the US, Germany, and Switzerland) or disintegrate as a result of centrifugal forces (such as the United Arab Republic, created in 1958, from which Egypt and Syria emerged three years later).
The confederation that I advocate would therefore be an interim solution (for five or ten years), with the likelihood of full independence for Kosovo at the end.
Such a postponement of a final settlement would also give time to explore Kosovo's chances of joining the EU, which would ultimately mean exercising sovereign authority along with other independent states, and could also defuse Kosovo's dangerously stubborn nationalist claims.
A Conservative Europe
Last week, Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schröder met in Berlin.
They fell apart over a commitment to revive growth in Europe.
We have heard this empty promise before.
The European Union needs a new direction instead.
I say this as the leader of the party that has been at the forefront of Britain's deal with Europe.
It was a Conservative government that first applied for membership in the early 1960s.
A Conservative government led the United Kingdom into the European Economic Community in 1973.
Margaret Thatcher worked with Jacques Delors on agreeing to the single market in 1986.
That is why I have no doubt that Britain must remain influential within the Union.
But British policy towards the EU has often led to poorer rather than better relations between member states.
Our traditional response to a new EU initiative has often been to reject it, vote against it, lose the vote, and then sulkily accept the initiative, blaming everyone else.
Many Europeans are tired of British vetoes.
So am I.
Of course, there are basic conditions that all member states must accept.
First and foremost are the four freedoms of the internal market: free movement of goods, services, people and capital.
However, an internal market does not require a single social or industrial policy, much less a common tax policy.
It promotes competitiveness by enabling countries to pursue their own policies in these areas.
Enforcing common policies means that Europe will fall further behind, as member states pass on their costs to their neighbors.
Which areas should be applied to all member states and which should be optional?
I think that every Member State should apply the directives which have no direct and significant influence on other Member States.
In areas that serve their national interests, individual member states should decide whether to maintain overall national control or cooperate with others.
Members of the Union should form a series of overlapping rounds: Member States in different combinations should be able to pool their obligations in different areas of their choice.
There are examples of this.
NATO has been flexible from the outset.
France signed the declaration of accession but later refused to place its military forces under NATO's high command.
Similar flexibility exists in the case of the euro, the Schengen Agreement and the Social Charter.
These examples can be expanded.
Until now, everyone has had to move forward together, with individual countries negotiating certain options for non-participation.
Since 1998, however, there has been a procedure within the agreements - called enhanced cooperation - which could allow some members to continue integration in a particular area without involving all the other members.
For example, individual member states do not have to engage in tense negotiations about the possibility of not participating in a new initiative, but those who support the initiative can simply choose to do so.
Countries that want to integrate further can do so.
They don't need to drag Britain and others kicking and screaming in their wake because they are not compelled to follow.
In this way, we can free ourselves from the institutionalised tug of war that has characterised EU relations.
I do not mean a two-speed Europe.
That would require us all to agree on the destination and to disagree only on the speed of the journey.
I do not want to achieve the goal that some of our partners may want to achieve.
But I don't want to stand in their way.
Some argue that this would mean losing influence for countries that opt out of closer integration.
Influence in itself is not an end - it is a means to an end.
Britain does not have to be at the table when decisions on the euro are taken.
Staying outside has not had a negative impact on our economy.
Sticking with the pound does not mean we reject the euro or want it to fail.
The European Union should stop trying to do everything and concentrate on doing less things more effectively.
It should give member states the chance to develop an approach to Europe that reflects their national traditions, within the EU fabric.
This is the basis on which British Conservatives reject the constitutional proposal.
We disagree, of course, with many of the contents, but we also reject the idea of having an EU Constitution at all.
There is a world of difference between an association of nation states bound together by a treaty and a single legal entity, whether it is called a state or not, with its own legal personality, which derives its authority from its own constitution.
If this Constitution were adopted in the form proposed, the EU would gain a lot of attributes and symbols of statehood: its own president and foreign minister, its own legal system.
The supremacy of EU law would not derive from the laws of national parliaments, but from a supranational constitution.
This is a radical change, not, as some believe, a mere clean-up.
I do not think it is right to make a change of this magnitude without explicitly consulting the people on whose behalf we govern.
Elected parliaments do not have our freedoms.
They protect them and should not diminish these freedoms without an explicit mandate.
Any proposal for a new constitution must be presented to the British people and to all other citizens in each of the EU member states.
A conspiracy so immense...
NEW YORK - Is this the age of conspiracy theories?
There is much to suggest that we are living in a kind of golden age of speculation, documentation, and conclusions by citizens that usually manifest themselves over the Internet and spread virally around the globe.
Conspiracy theories are wrenched from the margins of public discourse, where they have generally been relegated in the past, and sometimes find their way right to the center of politics.
I became aware of this purely by chance.
As the author of a book about the abuse of executive power in the US during the Bush years, I stumbled across online conversations that enthusiastically explore stories of behind-the-scenes manipulation while researching new developments.
There are some key issues here.
A common theme in the US is that global elites, through the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations among others, are secretly plotting to create a world government dominated by themselves rather than national governments.
Sometimes more folkloric details come into play, the members of this cabal being the Illuminati, the Freemasons, Rhodes scholarship holders or, as always, the Jews.
The main features of this story are familiar to anyone who has dealt with passing on certain types of stories in times of crisis.
In literary terms, this conspiracy theory closely resembles the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, with a secretive global elite of great power and reprehensible goals.
Historically, the issue has tended to be the same: fearsome, uncontrolled upheavals led by educated, urbanized cosmopolitans.
Anyone who has studied the Weimar Republic knows that sudden upheavals and shocks, rapid urbanization, the disruption of traditional family and social relations, the loosening of sexual restrictions, and the economic collapse made many Germans susceptible at the time to simplistic theories that seemed to resolve their confusion and give greater meaning to their suffering.
Similarly, today <unk>'s 9 / 11 Truth Movement claims that the attack on the two World Trade Center towers was an inside job.
There is a widespread conspiracy theory in the Muslim world that the Israelis were behind the attacks and that all the Jews working in the buildings stayed at home on September 11.
Conspiracy theories usually arise where people are uneducated and there is no thoroughly independent press.
So why do such theories find adherents in the US and other wealthy democracies today?
Today's explosive proliferation of conspiracy theories is fueled by the same circumstances that guided their acceptance in the past: rapid social change and profound economic uncertainty.
A clearly designated enemy with an unmistakable plan is psychologically more comfortable than the chaotic evolution of social norms and the workings or failures of unchecked capitalism.
And, while conspiracy theories are often patently irrational, the questions they raise are often reasonable, even if the answers are often unsubstantiated or simply wrong.
In their search for answers, these citizens respond rationally to irrational realities.
Many citizens believe, and rightly so, that their mass media fail to investigate and document abuses.
In most advanced countries, newspapers struggle or give up; investigative reporting is often the first to be cut back.
The concentration of media ownership and control further fuels public mistrust and prepares the ground for citizen investigative action to fill this vacuum.
Likewise, in an age when corporate lobbyists have a free hand in shaping, if not drafting, public policy, many people (once again rightly) feel that their elected officials no longer represent them.
Hence their tendency to believe in invisible forces.
Finally, even rational people are now more susceptible to certain conspiracy theories, because we have actually seen a number of elaborate conspiracies in the past eight years.
The Bush administration conspired to drag Americans and others into an illegal war using fabricated evidence.
Is it any wonder, then, that so many rational people are trying to make sense of a political reality that has, in fact, become unusually confusing?
If even members of the 9 / 11 Committee of Inquiry dissociate themselves from their own conclusions (because they were based on evidence obtained under torture), is it surprising that many want a second inquiry?
It happens often enough that citizens who dig around the edges of discourse and adhere to such theories report news that is ignored by the mainstream media.
For example, one <unk> conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, first documented the use of microwave technology against US citizens by American police.
The New Yorker later confirmed the story without citing the original source.
The incumbent media's tendency not to review or publish what is actually newsworthy in the field of conspiracy theories on the Internet partly reflects a class bias.
Conspiracy theories are considered vulgar and intellectually unsophisticated.
So even meaningful critical questions or well-documented data brought to light by investigative citizens tend to be treated like radioactive garbage by well-trained, official journalists.
The real problem with all these wild conspiracy theories is that they leave citizens agitated but without a solid evidence base on which to base their worldview, and without a constructive direction in which to channel their emotions.
That is why so many threads of discussion turn potentially interesting speculation from citizens into hate speech and paranoia.
In a febrile environment with no good editorial vetting or documentation tools, citizens can be exploited and incited by demagogues, as was seen at Sarah Palin's campaign rallies in recent weeks after Internet theories portrayed Barack Obama as a terrorist or in league with terrorists.
We need to change the flow of information in the Internet age.
Citizens should be better able to provide information, stories, and clues to investigative reporters in the mainstream media.
They should set up new online entities where they can pay a fee for direct investigative reporting without being influenced by economic pressure.
And investigative citizens should be trained in basic aspects of journalism: how to find good data, have stories corroborated by two independent sources, cite responsibly, and avoid anonymity, just as conventional reporters do.
In this way, citizens can be seriously seen as documentarians and researchers of our common situation, and consider themselves as such.
At a time when officials cannot be trusted, healthy investigative energy should brighten, not just heat up.
Constitutional coup in Ukraine
Changing the constitution is always a delicate business.
But it becomes dangerous when only one man is supposed to benefit.
After all, if a president voluntarily reduces the powers of his office, it can be assumed that he is not doing a good job.
That is precisely what is happening in Ukraine at the moment, where President Leonid Kuchma has proposed replacing the presidential system with a strange kind of parliamentary system that he invented himself.
Kuchma did not suddenly realize that parliamentary democracies are better than presidential ones.
No, Kuchma only wants to change the Ukrainian constitution in order to stay in power.
Kuchma now rules as an all-powerful president.
But his term ends next year and he is barred from running.
Instead of leaving office with dignity, as presidents from Bill Clinton to Boris Yeltsin have done, Kuchma wants to change the constitution to become an all-powerful prime minister with an unlimited term.
Of course, constitutions are not there to preserve an intolerable state of affairs.
Constitutions can and should, if necessary, provide for reforms.
A powerful president need not necessarily be wrong for Ukraine, either.
In the difficult post-communist transition period, it is vital that a government can act decisively.
Changing a system that is best suited to Ukraine therefore requires a good reason.
Ukraine's president is empowered to appoint and dismiss the prime minister, dissolve parliament, and govern by decree if he thinks the country's institutions are at risk.
He is in control of every aspect of government.
Such a powerful ruler must be above reproach.
This is not Kuchma. Quite the contrary.
In Ukraine, it is not the constitution that has degenerated, but the president, who is embroiled in cases of corruption and journalist killings.
As president, Kuchma is grotesquely unpopular.
Even Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia had more support before his fall.
Kuchma therefore knows that, unlike Yeltsin, he cannot choose a hand-picked successor.
With no such tame successor in sight, Kuchma now wants to establish what he calls a "parliamentary republic," a state with a weak president and a powerful prime minister.
He envisions a kind of parliament in which the authoritarian rule of the criminal Kuchma clans continues unabated under the guise of parliamentarianism.
People all too easily forget about Ukraine, that great country on the border of the soon-to-be enlarged European Union.
But any attempt to prolong Kuchma's rule will lead to such political chaos that it does not seem out of place that Ukraine, like Belarus or the Balkans, slid into dictatorship and chaos in the early 1990 "s.
It could get even worse, because Russia is unlikely to sit idly by and watch Ukraine unravel.
Intervention of one kind or another seems likely in these circumstances.
Only an imperialist Russia, however, would dare annex Ukraine.
An imperialist Russia, however, cannot be a democratic Russia.
Kuchma not only threatens freedom and human rights in Ukraine, but also democracy in Russia.
Fortunately, however, there has never been a better time for the West - especially the EU - to rescue Ukraine from the abyss.
All Ukrainians fear that EU enlargement next spring will create a new wall dividing their country from the EU's easternmost external border in Poland.
Although maintaining democracy in Ukraine is primarily a matter for Ukrainians, the EU can take practical steps to reassure Ukrainians that they will not be cut off from the rest of Europe.
Two possible measures would be a generous visa regime and the creation of regional development funds in Ukraine to benefit the impoverished eastern part of Poland.
However, these measures should be subject to the condition that Kuchma does not infringe the Ukrainian constitution and democracy.
Nor should the EU have any inhibitions about interfering in Ukraine's internal affairs.
After all, a few years ago it did not hesitate to impose sanctions on one Member State, Austria, when it was concerned about the welfare of democracy in that country.
The unpredictable Kuchma deserves much more security measures to monitor his well-being.
Similarly, the US should treat Kuchma's decision to send troops to Iraq with caution.
America's faith in Ukrainian democracy cannot be bought so cynically.
In Ukraine itself, a government that is actually capable of governing should ensure that EU laws and norms are adopted in exactly the same way as has been done in the current accession countries, in order to clean up the shady system in which Kuchma's criminal cronies thrive.
The Constitution must be reformed, but not to transfer power from one almighty ruler to another.
Clear control of arbitrariness and transparency in decision-making are needed.
No one should doubt that Kuchma intends to remain in power at all costs.
More questionable is whether he feels secure enough to hold a presidential election (or any other) if he cannot amend the constitution in a way that guarantees him further abuses of power.
After all, President Kuchma is discredited, not Ukraine's constitution.
The spread of bad ideas
NEW YORK - The Great Recession of 2008 has turned into a North Atlantic recession: it is primarily Europe and the US, not the major emerging markets, that have been caught in a state of slow growth and high unemployment.
And it is Europe and America, alone and together, who are heading for the dénouement of a great debacle.
A burst bubble led to massive Keynesian stimulus measures that prevented a much deeper recession, but also created significant budget deficits.
The response to these massive spending cuts is that unacceptably high unemployment (a huge waste of resources and needless suffering) may persist for many years to come.
The European Union has finally committed itself to helping its members in financial difficulty.
It had no choice: with financial turmoil threatening to spread from small countries like Greece and Ireland to large ones like Italy and Spain, the very survival of the euro was increasingly in jeopardy.
Europe's leaders recognized that the debts of countries in financial distress would become unmanageable if their economies could not grow, and that such growth would not be attainable without help.
But, at the same time that Europe's leaders promised that help was on the way, they stiffened on the need for non-crisis countries to cut spending.
The resulting austerity measures will hamper Europe's growth, and hence that of its most needy economies: after all, nothing would help Greece more than robust growth for its trading partners.
Moreover, low growth reduces tax revenues, undermining the loudly proclaimed goal of fiscal consolidation.
The pre-crisis discussions have shown how little has been done to improve economic fundamentals.
The European Central Bank's vehement opposition to restructuring the debts of failed or insolvent entities, indispensable in all capitalist economies, is evidence of the continuing fragility of the Western banking system.
The ECB argued that taxpayers should take over Greece's bad sovereign debt in its entirety, fearing that private sector involvement would trigger a credit event that could force large payouts on credit default swaps (CDS) and fuel further financial turmoil.
But if this is a real concern for the ECB (i.e., it is not merely acting on behalf of private creditors), it should surely have demanded that banks be provided with more capital.
Likewise, the ECB should have blocked banks "access to the risky CDS market, where they are held hostage by rating agencies" decisions about what constitutes a credit event.
Indeed, it was a positive achievement by European leaders at the recent summit in Brussels that they began to rein in both the ECB and the power of America's credit rating agencies.
Indeed, the strangest aspect of the ECB's stance was its threat to refuse to accept restructured government bonds as collateral if the rating agencies decided that the restructuring should be classified as a credit event.
The purpose of the restructuring was to pay down debt and make the remaining debt burden easier to manage.
If the bonds were acceptable as collateral before the restructuring, they would certainly be safer and therefore equally acceptable after the restructuring.
This episode should serve as a warning that central banks are political institutions with a political agenda, and that independent central banks tend (at least cognitively) to be captured by the banks they are supposed to control.
Across the Atlantic, things are hardly looking any better.
There, the far right threatened to immobilize the US government, thus confirming what game theory suggests: when those who are irrationally committed to destruction, when they cannot impose their will, confront rational people, the former prevail.
As a result, President Barack Obama has embraced an unbalanced debt-reduction strategy without tax increases, not even for the millionaires who have done so well over the past two decades, and not even in the form of eliminating tax giveaways to oil companies that undermine economic efficiency and contribute to environmental degradation.
Optimists argue that the short-term macroeconomic impact of the deal to raise America's debt ceiling and avoid a government default will be limited, with about $25 billion in spending cuts in coming years.
But the payroll tax cut (which put more than $100 billion in the pockets of ordinary Americans) has not been extended, and businesses, fearful of its contractionary effects in the future, will surely be even more reluctant to lend.
The completion of the stimulus measures themselves is contractual.
And with house prices continuing to fall, GDP growth faltering, and unemployment stubbornly high (one in six Americans who would like a full-time job can't get one), more stimulus, not austerity, would be needed to balance the budget.
The main driver of deficit growth is low tax revenues due to weak economic performance; the best remedy would be to create jobs.
The latest debt deal was a step in the wrong direction.
There is great concern about financial contagion between Europe and America.
After all, America's financial mismanagement played an important role in causing Europe's problems, and financial turmoil in Europe would not be good for the US, especially given the fragility of the US banking system and the continuing role it plays in non-transparent CDS.
But the real problem stems from another form of contagion: bad ideas spill over easily into other countries, and misguided economic ideas on both sides of the Atlantic reinforce each other.
The same will apply to the stagnation that this policy entails.
Cool analysis of global warming
The British Government has recently published the most comprehensive study to date on the costs and risks of global warming and measures that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in the hope of averting some of the worst consequences.
The report, written under the leadership of Sir Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, my successor as chief economist of the World Bank, makes it clear that the question is no longer whether we can afford to do something about global warming, but whether we can afford to do nothing about it.
The report proposes an agenda whose cost would be only 1% of annual consumption, but which would prevent the world from risking costs that would be five times higher.
The costs of global warming mentioned in the report are higher than in previous studies, because they take into account the mounting evidence that the process of global warming is highly complex and non-linear, with a negligible probability of progressing much faster than previously thought, and that the extent of warming could be much greater than previously expected.
The study may even vastly underestimate the costs: climate change may lead to greater weather volatility, for example, or to a possible disappearance or major shift in the Gulf Stream, which is particularly troubling for Europe and the spread of disease.
In 1995, when I sat on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the scientific body that periodically assesses the evidence on global warming, there was overwhelming evidence that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had increased significantly since the dawn of the industrial revolution, that human activities had contributed significantly to this increase, and that this would have a major impact on climate and sea levels.
But few thought that Arctic ice, for example, would melt as fast as it now appears to be.
However, some suggest that we should do little or nothing because we are not sure how serious global warming will be.
I believe that this uncertainty should lead us to act more decisively now, not more decisively.
A scientist friend of mine puts it this way: if you are driving on a mountain road in a car whose brakes may fail, and approaching a cliff while a bank of fog rises, should you drive more carefully or less carefully?
Global warming is one of the rare cases where scientists are more afraid of what might happen than the general public.
They took a cursory look at what the future might hold.
As Stern's report points out, the poor are, as always, the most defenceless.
A third of Bangladesh will be submerged by the end of this century.
The Maldives and several Pacific island states will disappear: our twenty-first century Atlantis.
For an economist, the problem is obvious: polluters do not bear the full cost of the damage they cause.
Pollution is an externality of enormous proportions.
Developed countries certainly do not want to harm Bangladesh and the disappearing island states, but no war could be more devastating.
A globally agreed tax rate is the best way to deal with a global externality.
This does not mean an increase in total taxation, but simply that some of the current taxes in each country will be replaced by an environmental tax (carbon tax).
It makes far more sense to tax bad things, such as pollution, than good things, such as savings and labour.
Although President George W. Bush claims to believe in markets, he has called for voluntary action in this case.
But it makes far more sense to harness market forces and the power of incentives than to rely on goodwill, especially when it comes to oil companies that see profit maximization as their only goal, regardless of the cost to others.
Exxon has reportedly funded so-called think tanks to undermine confidence in the findings on global warming, just as the tobacco industry has funded studies to challenge the validity of statistical evidence showing the link between smoking and cancer.
Some companies even seem to celebrate the melting of the polar ice caps, because it will reduce the cost of extracting the oil that lies beneath the Arctic Ocean.
The good news is that there are many ways to reduce emissions through improved incentives, in part by eliminating the myriad subsidies for inefficient uses.
The US subsidizes ethanol from corn and imposes tariffs on ethanol from sugar. The tax code conceals billions of dollars in subsidies for the oil and gas industry.
Most importantly, price signals that reflect the true social cost of extracting energy from fossil fuels will encourage innovation and conservation.
Small changes to certain practices, when embraced by hundreds of millions of people, can make a huge difference.
For example, simply changing the colour of roofs in warm areas to reflect sunlight or planting trees around houses can save a lot of energy for air conditioning.
We only have one planet and we should appreciate it.
Global warming is a risk that we simply cannot ignore any longer.
A crisis in two stories
CHICAGO - The world's industrialized democracies are in crisis, and two different stories are circulating to explain their cause and appropriate countermeasures.
The first, and better known, diagnosis is that pre-crisis demand collapsed due to high debt.
The households (and states) that have spent the most can no longer borrow.
To revive growth, others must be encouraged to spend; governments that are still creditworthy must increase their deficits; and low interest rates must discourage households from saving.
In these circumstances, fiscal recklessness is a virtue, at least in the short term.
Once growth resumes in the medium term, the debt can be repaid and the financial sector reined in so that it does not plunge the world into another crisis.
This story, the standard Keynesian statement adapted to the debt crisis, is the one most politicians, central bankers and Wall Street economists have embraced, and it doesn't need to be expanded.
It has the advantage of giving politicians clear guidance and promising results that are adapted to the political cycle.
Unfortunately, despite the incentives already in place, growth is still weak, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to find sensible and worthwhile new spending opportunities in the short term.
Attention thus shifts to the second story, which is that advanced economies "basic ability to grow by producing useful things has been declining for decades, a trend that has been masked only by debt-fueled spending.
Returning these countries to sustainable growth cannot be achieved through further such spending.
Instead, the environment for growth must improve.
This second story begins in the 1950 "s and 1960" s, a time of rapid growth in the West and Japan.
This long upswing was due to several factors, including post-war reconstruction, the revival of trade after the protectionist 1930s, the introduction of new technologies in energy production, transport, and global communications, and the improvement of education.
But, as Tyler Cowen describes in his book The Great Stagnation, after picking these low-hanging fruit from the 1970s onwards, it became much harder to sustain growth.
As Wolfgang Streeck convincingly writes in the New Left Review, after the seemingly endless perspective of innovation and growth of the 1960s, democratic governments were only too willing to expand the welfare state.
But, as growth slowed, government spending expanded while resources shrank.
For a time, this spending policy was supported by the central bank.
The resulting high inflation aroused great resentment, especially because growth remained weak.
Confidence in Keynesian stimulus has waned, even as high inflation has reduced public debt.
Central banks then set low and stable inflation as their main objective and gained greater independence from their political superiors.
But debt-based government spending continued, and advanced countries "public debt as a percentage of GDP continued to rise steadily since the late 1970s, this time without inflation to reduce its value.
Faced with the need to find new sources of growth, the United States deregulated industry and finance at the end of Jimmy Carter's presidency and then under Ronald Reagan, as Margaret Thatcher had done in Britain.
Over time, productivity in these countries grew substantially, prompting continental Europe to undertake its own reforms, often driven by the European Commission.
But even that growth was not enough, given previous governments "generous pension and welfare promises, which have been made even more difficult by rising life expectancy and falling birth rates.
Public debt continued to rise.
And middle-class incomes did not benefit from deregulation-driven growth (though it did improve their position as consumers).
Recently, the industrialized countries "frantic search for growth has taken on other forms.
In some countries, particularly the US, a private-sector credit boom created new, low-skill jobs in sectors like construction, and unleashed a consumption frenzy through mortgages on overvalued homes.
In other countries, such as Greece and parts of Italy and Spain, middle-class jobs were created by governments themselves creating jobs on a large scale.
In this fundamental story, pre-crisis developed countries "pre-crisis GDP was boosted by borrowing and unproductive job creation, so it was unsustainable.
Continued growth based on the Keynesian recipe may maintain the illusion of normality and be useful for reassurance after a deep crisis, but it is not a solution to a fundamental growth problem.
If this diagnosis is correct, developed countries must focus on boosting innovation and productivity in the medium term, adapting social promises to revenue opportunities, while alleviating the plight of the truly needy in the short term.
In southern Europe, for example, the potential for growth could be deregulation of service sectors and a reduction in job protection to create more private-sector jobs for laid-off public employees and unemployed young people.
In the US, the task is to bridge the gap between potential jobs and workers "actual skills.
People know their own needs better than the government and behave accordingly.
Many women, for example, leave their low-paying jobs to acquire skills that give them access to more lucrative jobs.
The government has paid too little attention to such issues, for example, because effects would have occurred only in later parliamentary terms, or because the effectiveness of government programs has left something to be desired.
Incentives to retrain and take up work, on the other hand, could be provided by tax reform, which could also plug budget gaps.
Hopefully, more jobs can be created in the future, with three powerful tools helping: better use of information and communication technology (and new ways to make it profitable), lower energy costs by tapping alternative sources, and greatly increased demand for high-value emerging-market goods.
Developed countries have a choice.
They can pretend everything is fine and the problem is merely anxious consumers whose animal instincts need to be stimulated.
Or they can see the crisis as a wake-up call to solve the problems that have been whitewashed in recent decades.
Whatever happens, the future of these countries and that of the global economy ultimately depends on what history governments and people are convinced of.
A crisis of confidence
LONDON Public confidence in financial institutions and the authorities charged with regulating them was among the first victims of the financial crisis.
This is hardly surprising, as previously respected firms revealed that they did not fully understand the securities they were trading in or the risks they were taking.
It is difficult not to feel secret schadenfreude at the well-deserved punishment of the Masters of the Universe.
But unfortunately, if this loss of confidence continues, it could cost us all dearly.
As Ralph Waldo Emerson noted, "Our mistrust is very expensive," as Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow made this observation nearly 40 years ago: "It can be plausibly argued that much of the world's economic backwardness can be explained by the lack of mutual trust."
Indeed, many economic studies show a strong relationship between a community's level of confidence and its overall economic performance.
Without mutual trust, economic activity is severely limited.
Even within Europe, there is strong evidence that countries where mutual trust is higher achieve higher levels of investment (especially through venture capital investment) and are willing to adopt more flexible contracts that also promote growth and investment.
So if it is true that confidence in financial institutions and in the governments that oversee them has been damaged by the crisis, then we should take that extremely seriously and find answers to rebuild that trust.
The evidence of a crisis of confidence is rather difficult to interpret.
In the UK, recent polls have been ambiguous.
Surveys sponsored by financial firms tend to show that trust in them has not fallen particularly sharply, and that people still trust them more than they do the National Health Service or the BBC.
Polls promoted by the BBC tend to portray the situation in reverse.
Banks cite statistics to show that they are trusted more than supermarkets, while supermarkets cite evidence to the contrary, and so they expand into the financial services sector in the belief that the public will trust them more than the banks, which had to be bailed out dearly by the government.
The market will be right on one side in not too long.
In the United States, there is now a more systematic, independent survey conducted by economists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
Its index of confidence in the financial sector, based on a large-scale survey of financial policymakers in American households, shows a sharp decline in confidence in late 2008 and early 2009, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
The decline in confidence affected banks, the stock market, the government and its regulators.
The survey also showed that declining confidence was strongly correlated with behaviour in financial matters.
In other words, if one's confidence in the market and its regulation fell sharply, one was less likely to invest in banks or stocks.
As a result, declining confidence had real economic consequences.
Fortunately, the latest survey, published in July this year, shows that trust in banks and bankers has begun to recover, and to do so quite sharply.
That was positive for the stock market.
There is also slightly more confidence in the government's actions and financial regulation than at the end of last year.
The last point is particularly important; it undoubtedly reflects the Obama administration's attempts to reform the dysfunctional system that it inherited, because the sharpest decline in investment intentions was among those who had lost faith in the government's ability to regulate.
Restoring confidence in the US Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission seems more important economically than restoring confidence in Citibank or AIG.
Continued controversy in Congress over the precise details of the reform could therefore have an economic cost if the impression is reinforced that the system is not being overhauled.
All of this data is statistical, reflecting the average views of voters and investors.
Yet we also know that individual views are remarkably heterogeneous.
Some people have enormous confidence in others and in the companies and institutions with which they conduct their business.
Others are inherently suspicious.
Researchers at the European University Institute in Florence and UCLA recently showed that there is a relationship between trust and income.
On the basis of a pan-European opinion poll carried out over many years, we can relate the two.
This survey asks simple but effective questions about the tendency of individuals to trust those with whom they do business.
The data provide startling evidence that those whose confidence is well below the average of the country in which they live are more likely to have lower incomes.
Is this only because people on low incomes feel that life is unfair and therefore mistrust those around them?
It does not seem so, as even very trusting people have a lower income than the average.
In other words, if one deviates significantly from the average level of trust in society, one is likely to fall short, either because one mistrusts others so much that one misses opportunities for investment and mutually beneficial trade, or because one is so trusting that one can easily be deceived and exploited.
When a stranger says, 'Trust me, <unk> has an irritating tick in conversations,' I usually close my purse.
Most academics, who are at the lower end of the skill-adjusted income distribution, may do the same.
Maybe we should trust each other more, but not too much.
A crisis of understanding
NEW HAVEN - Few economists predicted the current economic crisis, and there is widespread disagreement about its ultimate causes.
And it should come as no surprise that economists are not well placed to predict how quickly the crisis will end.
Of course, we all know the immediate causes of an economic crisis: people do not spend because their incomes have fallen or their jobs are at risk, or both.
But you can go a step further: people's incomes are lower and their jobs are at risk because they haven't spent money recently, and so on, backwards in time, in a repetitive feedback loop.
It's a vicious circle, but where and why did it start?
Why has he tightened up?
And how can it be revised?
Economists have so far been unable to provide clear answers to these questions.
In the Great Depression, which followed the collapse of stock markets in 1929, economic knowledge was just as flawed.
Economists had not predicted this either.
In the 1920 "s, some warned that the stock market was overpriced, but they did not predict a decade-long depression that would affect the entire economy.
Towards the end of the Great Depression, in August 1938, an article by Ralph M. Blagden in The Christian Science Monitor reported an informal series of interviews with American professors, banking experts, union leaders, and representatives of business associations and political groups, all of whom were asked the same question: "What causes recessions?" The multitude of answers baffled and did not exactly foster confidence that anyone knew what had caused capitalism's worst crisis yet.
The causes cited were widely spread across government, workers, industry, international politics and policies.
They included misguided interference in markets, high income and capital gains taxes, flawed monetary policy, pressure for high wages, monopolies, excessive inventories, the uncertainty caused by the Supreme Court's plan to reorganize, the rearming of Europe and the fear of war, the encouragement of labor struggles by the government, a capital glut caused by a shrinking population, the passing of the American frontier, and lax lending before the Depression.
Although economic theory has improved considerably, when we ask people about the causes of the current crisis, we get more or less the same answers, and certainly a few new ones: unprecedented bubbles in the real estate market, a global capital glut, international trade imbalances, exotic financial contracts, substandard mortgages, unregulated over-the-counter markets, mistakes by credit rating agencies, compromised real estate valuations, and negligence in counterparty risk.
It is more likely that many or most of these people are overwhelmingly, or at least partially, right, because the economic crisis was caused by the interplay of many factors - the accidental confluence of a lot of unfavorable things that put pressure on the financial system beyond its limits.
At that point, the difficulties came to the fore, destroying public confidence and triggering a negative feedback loop.
After all, we naturally turn our attention to particularly bad events, and precisely because particularly bad events are statistical outliers, they probably have multiple causes.
Consider the question of predicting events such as the earthquake in Haiti in January 2010, which killed more than 200,000 people.
It caught our attention because it claimed so many lives and caused so much damage to property.
But trying to go beyond predicting earthquakes to predicting their damage would surely produce a long list of factors, including political, financial and insurance factors similar to the list of factors that caused the Great Depression.
Indeed, the list of causes of the crisis is endless, for in a complex economic system with many different feedbacks, the triggers of a vicious circle can be as seemingly trivial as the proverbial Amazon butterfly, which, by flapping its wings, sets in motion a chain of events that eventually culminates in a far-off hurricane.
Chaos theory in mathematics explains this dependence on remote and seemingly trivial initial conditions and explains why even the extrapolation of seemingly precise planetary movements becomes impossible if extrapolated far enough into the future.
Meteorologists, too, cannot forecast far into the future, but at least they have accurate mathematical models.
In this process, computers with enormous capacities are connected in parallel in order to find numerical solutions to differential equations developed from fluid and thermodynamic theory. Scientists seem to know the mechanism that produces the weather, even though it is inherently difficult to extrapolate far into the future.
The problem with macroeconomics is that the types of causes cited in relation to the current crisis are difficult to systematise.
The mathematical models that macroeconomists have at their disposal may be similar to weather models in some respects, but their structural integrity is not guaranteed by a solid theory that establishes laws.
The most important new publication on the origins of the economic crisis, This Time Is Different by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, is essentially a summary of the lessons learned from virtually all historically documented financial crises around the world.
But the book is almost entirely non-theoretical.
It merely documents repetitive patterns.
Unfortunately, in the 800 years of financial history, there is only one example of a truly massive global contraction, the Great Depression of the 1930 "s.
So it is hard to say what to expect based on Reinhart and Rogoff's analysis of the current contraction.
All that remains is an attempt to use the patterns of past, dissimilar crises to create a probable prognosis for the current crisis.
As a result, we simply do not know whether the coming recovery will be solid or disappointing.
A remedy for fiscal failure?
CAMBRIDGE - Should more countries establish independent fiscal-policy advisory councils to inject greater objectivity into national budget debates?
Jailed fraudster Bernie Madoff recently summed up the feelings of a lot of people when he declared: "The whole government is a snowball system."
Perhaps it was just the wishful thinking of a man who will end his life in prison after his own record-breaking $50 billion Ponzi scheme collapsed in 2008.
Personally, I suspect Madoff's unenviable place in the record books will endure for some time to come.
Nonetheless, with many governments around the world facing a lethal combination of unsustainable conventional debt, unprecedented pension liabilities, and a slowdown in economic growth, one must ask how they intend to address this fiscally.
In our new paper, "A Decade of Debt," Carmen M. Reinhart and I show that the total public debt of the United States, that is, federal, state, and local governments, now exceeds the record 120% of GDP reached at the end of World War II.
Japan, of course, is far worse off, with total public debt exceeding 200% of GDP.
While this is partially offset by foreign exchange reserves, Japan now faces huge disaster-response costs, in addition to depressing demographic trends.
Debt levels in many other countries are now uncomfortably close to their highest levels in 150 years, even though much of the world is relatively peaceful.
There is no easy way out.
Currently, the cost of servicing debt is limited by low global interest rates, but these levels can be reduced only very gradually over long periods, while real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates can rise much faster, even for rich countries.
Debt crises tend to come out of the blue, hitting countries whose debt curve leaves no room for error or unplanned resistance.
The most immediate and direct impact of an independent fiscal policy would be to limit spending by countering the government's overly optimistic growth and revenue forecasts.
In principle, independent and universally respected advisory bodies would also force governments to acknowledge the hidden costs of government guarantees and off-balance-sheet debt.
It is high time to consider new approaches.
Of course, no single simple change will eliminate the enormous propensity for deficit spending in most modern political systems.
Nor will a single simple change eliminate the risk of future debt and inflation crises.
Major reforms are needed in many countries to make tax systems more efficient and to bring statutory entitlements, including pensions, more into line with reality.
The emergence of fiscal advisory councils recently is a promising institutional start.
A number of countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, the US, and Belgium, have long had fiscal watchdogs, such as the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO).
But, while these older institutions have proved enormously useful, their activities are usually severely constrained.
For example, the CBO is entitled to publish long-term tax projections based on its own growth projections, but at the same time it is largely forced to accept politically implausible future solutions that pretty much neutralize the potential effectiveness of its criticism.
To enhance their credibility, a number of governments are carefully setting up more independent fiscal councils, with central banks often serving as role models.
Councils in Sweden, Great Britain, Slovenia and Canada are leading the way.
The mandate of the Fiscal Policy Council in Sweden is particularly broad; it has a mandate not only to make forecasts, but also to take a deeper look at the motivation and consequences of government policies.
In principle, an independent fiscal council could have been invaluable during the financial crisis.
In the US, such an authority could have intervened on the costs and benefits of bailout plans, thereby helping to overcome parliamentary paralysis and toughen the nerves of giving taxpayers more upside risk.
It would be too much to expect these new fiscal institutions to become as important or as powerful as central banks, at least for the foreseeable future.
There is a much greater consensus on monetary policy than on fiscal policy.
And fiscal policy is far more complex and multi-layered.
Nonetheless, the general principle appears to be an important step toward fiscal accountability.
Of course, fiscal councils alone, no matter how well designed, are not enough.
It is very tempting for any generation to say, "My grandchildren will be twice or thrice as rich as I am, so who cares if they have to pay a few debts?" and the political cycle creates a very strong propensity for deficits, as politicians seek to reinforce feelings of economic health and prosperity by increasing visible spending at the expense of hidden debt and low long-term investment.
To withstand this strong pressure, the work of fiscal councils will have to be periodically reviewed by international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund, both to protect their independence and to increase their accountability.
Bernie Madoff may be right, but his pyramid scheme is not proving to be the greatest of all time.
But greater transparency and a more systematic, independent assessment of government policies could be a very helpful step toward solving the persistent problem of oversized deficits.
This is certainly one of the more innovative and promising ideas that have emerged recently from an otherwise rather barren political landscape.
A Customs Union for the Balkans
The fall of Milosevic does not heal the political woes of the Balkans, but rather increases the urgency with which this woe must be addressed.
Yugoslavia has disintegrated, but the dissolution is incomplete.
Vojislav Kostunica was elected President of Yugoslavia, but his mandate came only from support in Serbia.
Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in the Yugoslav Federation, has largely boycotted the election, while the Albanians in Kosovo have simply ignored it.
Nevertheless, it was Yugoslavia, which was unstable in its foundations, that was recently admitted to the UN.
A lot of issues remain unresolved: relations between Serbia and Montenegro, and the status of Kosovo (not to mention Serbia's northern province of Vojvodina).
All solutions, all proposals for change, will create new conflicts because of the conflicting claims to sovereignty.
Whatever the temptation to solve the problem by drawing new borders or creating new entities, this conundrum cannot be solved in terms of sovereignty.
This traditional solution would only perpetuate the problems of the Balkans.
A new approach is needed: the European Union should use the prospect of European integration as a way of promoting regional integration.
The EU could act as a magnet to bring the regions closer together by bringing the region as a whole closer to Europe.
This idea has great appeal to the people of the region, but only the EU can make it a reality.
Following NATO's intervention in Kosovo, European leaders have made this idea the cornerstone of their vision for the Balkans.
The idea itself was preserved in the Stability Pact signed at the Sarajevo Summit in July 1999.
But the Stability Pact is just a shell that needs to be filled with content.
The time to do this will be the conference in Zagreb on 24 November, convened by France as the current President of the EU.
The European Union should propose a three-point plan for the Balkans:
A Customs Union with preferential access to EU markets should be established within a one-year period; the existing EU-Turkey Customs Union could serve as a model.
Once all these states have reached an agreement with the EU, the free trade area will cover the whole of the Balkans.
Implementation of this will take some time.
But from the outset, the EU should send a signal and unilaterally open its borders to imports from the region.
This cannot jeopardise EU interests, since the countries concerned account for less than 1% of the EU market.
A regional VAT levy should be established within two years to make up for lost customs revenue.
Differences in indirect taxes, such as VAT, are another disadvantage, where borders become barriers to trade.
Taxes should be coordinated across the region.
Regional VAT rates may be slightly increased if expenditure restraint is not sufficient to compensate for the loss of customs revenue due to the customs union.
$Temporary budgetary support would have to be ensured on a gradually decreasing scale for three years, with the EU retaining overall control over budgetary expenditure.
As it will take some time to collect the revenue from the regional VAT, the EU should provide financial assistance during the conversion.
The area covered by this plan includes Bulgaria, Croatia and Albania, as well as Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo.
Participation by Romania and Moldova would be voluntary.
Provided that it does not interfere with their candidacy for EU membership, Bulgaria and Croatia could be persuaded to participate.
Depending on the country, budgetary support could be greater or smaller.
(Bulgaria, for example, might not need any compensation, as it has already eliminated a large part of the duties.)
Compared to the cost of military intervention and peacekeeping, the financial cost in this area is ridiculously low.
I estimate that EUR 750 million in the first year, EUR 500 million in the second year and EUR 250 million in the third year would fulfil their purpose.
(Including Romania and Moldova would slightly increase the figures mentioned).
These figures are still within the EU's pledges to the Stability Pact, and they could easily be reconciled with the limitations of the Berlin Agreement on the EU budget for 2000-2005, if only the EU member states agreed to redistribute the unspent funds.
Budgetary support in the context of a customs union would be a far more effective way of disbursing EU money than conventional methods can be.
The three-point programme outlined would lay the foundations for economic revival.
It would eliminate two of the main sources of corruption and ineffectiveness: the customs service and the misuse of public funds in general.
In addition, a trade area large enough to attract both local and foreign investment would be created.
The Deutschmark, already in circulation in the region, already functions as the single currency.
All bans on their use should be lifted so that barriers to trade and investment become irrelevant.
Improved economic prospects and strengthening of institutions would in turn have a positive impact on the political climate throughout the Balkans.
Serbia has already worked its way up a bit from the abyss.
The success in peacefully replacing a tyrant has set in motion a process of national renewal.
But this process will go on for a long time.
The opposition has inherited a bankrupt country whose institutions are in ruins.
The population, frustrated by the increasing impoverishment and isolation, is beginning to ask questions about what has happened in Serbia over the past decade.
People are asking about the crimes committed by the Milosevic regime against the Serbs.
They must also begin to come to terms with the crimes committed against other ethnic groups in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo.
Once the process is underway, many of the problems that seem difficult to deal with today can be resolved more easily.
Kostunica's election as President of Yugoslavia amounts to an unfinished revolution: many members of the old guard are still occupying their old positions.
The momentum generated by Milosevic's defeat must be maintained.
Milosevic was toppled in the hope of ending Serbia's isolation, and Europe must now keep its promise.
If the French EU Presidency fails to capitalise on the momentum in Zagreb, a historically unique opportunity will be lost.
A Czech moment
PRAGUE As I listened to what some Europeans were saying as my country prepared to take over the presidency of the European Union, I heard the faint echo of Neville Chamberlain's infamous description of Czechoslovakia as a distant country of which we know little, and I suspect that Donald Rumsfeld's misplaced attempt a few years ago to create a dividing line between new and old Europe contributed to the resurgence of that disdainful attitude.
The reality is that there is no such thing as old and new Europe, and never has been.
It is almost two decades since the break with communism and the reunification of Europe.
We Czechs are 100% European, and we were when the Iron Curtain separated us from democratic Europe.
Perhaps our pro-EU sentiments are all the stronger because our membership of the Union, like our freedom, is comparatively new.
So no one in Europe need fear that the Czech Republic is pursuing a nostalgic or idiosyncratic plan that it wants to impose on the EU.
On the contrary, events have imposed on Europe a plan from which we cannot escape and for which true unity will be needed.
The primary and most urgent of the problems we are facing is the financial and economic crisis that is engulfing the EU.
Unfortunately, conditions throughout the European Union are likely to deteriorate before they start to improve.
Social unrest such as that seen recently in Greece could spread, as the downturn is likely to take a disproportionate toll on Europe's young people, who are looking for work at a time when beleaguered European companies have very little to offer them.
Once again, it will be up to the European Union to help turn despair into hope.
We Czechs know this, because the painful economic upheavals we experienced in the 1990 "s taught us a lot about how the right policies can break the reign of hopelessness.
In order to contain today's financial and economic crisis, Europe will also have to continue the cooperation that it has shown up to this point.
The very existence of the European Union, and the euro in particular, has already helped prevent the competitive devaluations and beggar-thy-neighbour policies that wreaked havoc on Europe in the 1930s, the last time the continent faced such a brutal economic downturn.
But we cannot blithely assume that the forces of national egoism will continue to be held in check.
Currently, the coordinated recovery plan of EU governments has deprived populists of their usual charge that the EU is indifferent to the fate of individuals.
Even greater policy coordination will be needed, both to confront the crisis and to restore EU standards once the storm clouds begin to dissipate.
Although it is true that the Stability and Growth Pact has become more flexible in these exceptional times, its rules have ensured a successful first decade for the euro.
These rules must ultimately be restored intact if Europe is to return to the path of sustainable growth, and for this to happen, an agreement must be reached now.
The second major challenge facing us during our European Presidency is Russia.
A new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) must be negotiated between the EU and the Russian Federation.
These negotiations should have started in earnest last year, but the war in Georgia intervened and put them on hold.
These talks have now resumed, but the backdrop to the negotiations has changed dramatically.
Russia's economy is now in much worse shape than that of EU members.
The collapse in oil and gas prices has hit Russia's budget, and years of underinvestment in the country's energy sector is now leading to the decline in production that economists have long predicted.
Until now, Russia has been less interested in a new PCA than the EU, as two-thirds of Russia's exports to the Union consist of mineral resources that generate money even without the strict rules imposed by a PCA.
However, given the stark changes in economic conditions, it is now in Russia's national interest to reassure international markets that it is a reliable country for doing business, and a new PCA would be the ideal signal for this.
Moreover, without a new PCA, individual European countries may find it necessary to seek even more bilateral agreements with Russia.
Indeed, many EU members have been competing so far over who will be Russia's closest friend in the European Union.
But the bilateral agreements that have emerged from this contest are at the expense of other EU members and could unbalance relations within the European Union as a whole. Only a rules-based EU framework can provide a solid foundation for bilateral as well as Union-wide relations with Russia.
Europe's main strength in foreign policy is not its commitment to rules-based multilateralism, important as it undoubtedly is, but its unity.
When the Georgia crisis erupted, Europe agreed on a unified position on Russia's withdrawal.
It is the task of the Czech Republic and the Swedish EU Presidency, which will succeed ours, to maintain this unity as PCA negotiations continue.
In the 1990 "s, the US and Europe erred in treating Russia kindly, and it would be a mistake for Russia to respond in the same way today by trying to extend the PCA negotiations in the hope that a more approachable EU president might one day offer looser terms.
In our negotiations, like all EU presidencies, we will represent the general interests of the European Union.
A day of climate justice
PRINCETON - What we are doing to our planet, to our children and grandchildren, and to the poor as a result of our careless production of greenhouse gases is one of the great moral failures of our time.
On 24 October there is an opportunity to stand up against this injustice.
October 24 is 350 Climate Action Day.
The figure refers to the 350 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which, according to Jim Hansen, perhaps the most important climate scientist of our time, we should not exceed if we are to avert potentially catastrophic climate change.
This is the measure of the seriousness of our problem: the carbon dioxide level is already 386 parts per million and is increasing by a further two parts per million per year.
The need to curb greenhouse gases became increasingly clear when forecasts for global warming - described as "alarmist" a few years ago - repeatedly proved too conservative.
We are approaching the point from which there is no turning back and from which there are feedback effects that, regardless of what we do, will cause the planet to warm further.
One example is the melting of Arctic ice.
Four hundred years ago, explorers set out in search of the legendary Northeast Passage along the northern coasts of Europe and Russia to China.
However, the Arctic ice was impenetrable, so the search was abandoned.
This year, merchant ships were able to navigate the Northeast Passage without problems.
This is one of the many dramatic signs that our climate is changing and our planet is warmer than it has been for a long time.
But ice-free Arctic waters are more than a symptom of global warming.
They are themselves a cause of further warming, as ice and snow reflect sunlight.
In other words, with our greenhouse gas emissions, we caused warming that melted the Arctic ice, creating a feedback effect that leads to further warming and melts even more ice, even if we cease all greenhouse gas emissions tomorrow.
Other feedback effects pose a similar threat.
In Siberia, huge amounts of the extremely strong greenhouse gas methane are trapped in the soil layers previously known as permafrost, in regions thought to be permanently frozen.
But these permanently frozen areas are now thawing, releasing methane, which contributes to further warming, which in turn causes further thawing, releasing more methane into the atmosphere.
Developing countries now understand how outrageous the current distribution of greenhouse gas emissions really is.
At the UN climate summit in September, Rwandan President Paul Kagame pointed out that Africa - the continent with the fewest resources to tackle the problem - is likely to bear the worst effects of climate change, though it is actually the developed nations outside Africa that are responsible.
Kagame proposed giving each country an annual per capita quota for CO2 emissions, and allowing developing countries below their quotas to sell their surplus quotas to countries above.
The money that developing countries get for this would not be development aid, but a recognition that rich nations have to pay for something that they simply had in the past: far more than their fair share of the atmosphere's capacity to absorb our emissions.
Using studies by the UN Climate Change Committee, it was calculated that the total ecologically compatible CO2 emissions should not exceed 2,172 kilograms per person.
In fact, the figure was 4,700 kilograms per capita, or, in other words, more than twice the acceptable limit.
But while emissions in rich countries far exceeded that limit, emissions in Sri Lanka were far lower, at 660 kilograms per person.
The Sri Lankan government said: "This means that countries with low emissions like us cannot emit more greenhouse gases because developed nations or countries with massive carbon emissions are already claiming our share without our consent."
This situation is an immense injustice, reminiscent of the now outlawed colonialism of the Western powers in the 19th century, and arguably far worse.
The task of rectifying this must be tackled at the climate conference in Copenhagen in December.
Many political leaders have declared their support for resolute action on climate change, but what most see as resolute action will not be enough to get us below the 350 ppm mark.
In some countries, including the US, significant political hurdles need to be overcome in order to take even modest steps.
On 24 October, people in almost all countries will take action to raise awareness of the need for an international treaty to bring the CO2 content of our atmosphere back below 350 ppm.
Mountaineers in the Himalayas, where glaciers are melting, and divers in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, which is also threatened by climate change, will display banners.
Church bells will ring 350 times, 350 cyclists will circle cities and 350 trees will be planted in many places.
Under www.350.org you can inform yourself about actions in your area and participate in them or put your own idea on the net.
A Day of Liberation
In 1960, when I was seven years old, my grandmother Angelika opened my eyes to the significance of May 8, 1945, the day Nazi Germany surrendered and World War II ended in Europe.
We had just spent our summer holidays in Normandy, where the liberation of Europe from Nazism began on 6 June 1944, D-Day.
One evening, I heard my parents and grandmother talk about the past.
I forgot the details of the conversation, but I can still remember a sigh of relief from my grandmother when she said: "Thank God we lost that war!"
From a child's point of view, it was not so obvious that losing should be a good thing.
But, of course, my grandmother was right to equate defeat with liberation.
The more I thought about the lesson I learned 45 years ago, the more it struck me that there was a less obvious dimension to her statement, namely that we had lost the war.
Collectively, the Germans were not the innocent victims of a small criminal gang called the Nazis - Nazism was an internal ideology shared by millions of Germans, and every German was responsible for the atrocities, whether he or she personally adhered to that ideology or not.
In Germany today, an overwhelming majority agree that May 8, 1945, was a day of liberation, not just for Europe, but for Germany itself.
Compared to public opinion in 1960, this is certainly a huge step forward.
Paradoxically, however, one might also discover a bit of forgetfulness in it, for this statement conceals the fact that liberation required a military defeat.
In the words of my grandmother, it wasn't us who were the liberators, it was <unk> them.
The way people relate to the past tells us more about their present attitudes than about the past itself.
That's what <unk>'s politics of remembrance is all about.
For this reason, it does not matter whether the relevant events took place 60 years ago (as World War II), 90 years ago (as in the case of the Armenian genocide) or even 600 years ago (as in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389).
A violent conflict in the past can last into the present as a war of memories, as can be seen in the current conflict between China and South Korea on the one hand and Japan on the other.
A war of memories can in turn lead to a violent confrontation in the future.
Often, former perpetrators try to deny their former victims moral superiority by claiming to have been victims themselves.
That is why the 60th anniversary of the Allied bombing of Dresden on February 13, 1945, was probably more crucial to German policy of remembrance than the 60th anniversary of May 8, 1945.
Far-right groups have described the attack, which killed at least 30,000 people, as the Dresden bombing.
Fortunately, this propaganda campaign proved to be a failure.
While it is true that thousands of civilians killed in Dresden and other German cities were innocent on a personal level, there can be no doubt that it was morally imperative to defeat Germany collectively.
On the left side of the political spectrum, the statement of 8 May 1945 as Liberation Day is still undisputed.
Nevertheless, it is sometimes concealed that massive use of force was necessary to achieve this objective.
Left-wing pacifism tends to overlook this simple fact.
<unk>'s DAVID LLOYD reflects on the thrills and spills... the other half of the action, as it happened, with <unk>'s Lawrence Booth taking a look at the major talking points from the day's play...
There was a history of a lack of preventive resistance at home and abroad to the threat that Nazi Germany had built up in the 1930 "s.
And there is another lesson to be learned.
Yes, 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation to which the Soviet army made a decisive contribution.
But for millions of people in Central and Eastern Europe, liberation was followed by Stalin's oppression.
The current war of memories between the Baltic republics and Russia in view of the international celebrations in Moscow on 9 May reminds Germany of a special historical responsibility.
The German-Soviet non-aggression pact concluded in August 1939, the so-called Hitler-Stalin pact, contained a secret additional protocol in which Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania were assigned to the respective spheres of interest of the two parties.
But justifying Nazi atrocities by pointing to Stalinist crimes is an intellectually and morally unacceptable maneuver.
When Chancellor Schröder travels to Moscow to attend the Red Square celebrations, he should not forget Nazi Germany's contribution to the Baltic tragedy.
On 8 May this year, public speakers will remind us of the importance of not forgetting.
They will point out that history repeats itself if lessons are not learned.
This is also 100% true.
Personally, though, I will also remember my grandmother's phrase: "Thank God we lost this war, thank God, and thanks to all the brave Allied soldiers who sacrificed their lives to liberate Europe."
A deglobalised world?
Cambridge, Mass. - It may be a few months, it may be two years, but either way, the United States and other advanced economies will eventually recover from today's crisis.
But the global economy is unlikely to look like it does today.
Even once the crisis has peaked, we are likely to find ourselves in a somewhat de-globalised world, with slower-growing international trade, less external financing and a much reduced propensity for rich countries to run large current account deficits.
Is this the demise of the developing world?
Not necessarily.
Growth in the developing world tends to come in three forms.
The first is growth driven by foreign borrowing.
The second is growth as a byproduct of a commodity boom.
And the third is growth driven by economic restructuring and diversification into new products.
For the first two models, the risks are greater than for the third.
But they should not give us sleepless nights, because they are inadequate and ultimately unsustainable.
More worrying is the potential distress of the countries in the last group.
These countries will have to make significant policy changes in order to adapt to today's new realities.
The first two growth models inevitably come to a bad end.
Foreign credit can allow consumers and governments to live beyond their means for a while, but relying on foreign capital is an unwise strategy.
The problem is not only that foreign capital flows can easily reverse direction, but also that they generate the wrong kind of growth, based on overvalued currencies and investment in non-tradable goods and services, such as housing and construction.
Growth driven by high commodity prices is also prone to crisis, for similar reasons. Commodity prices tend to evolve in a cyclical way.
When prices are high, they tend to crowd out investment in manufactured goods and other non-traditional commodities.
Moreover, commodity booms in countries with weak institutions often produce ugly policies that lead to costly distributional battles over commodity yields, which are rarely invested wisely.
So it should come as no surprise that the countries that have achieved steady, long-term growth over the past six decades are those that have pursued a different strategy: promoting diversification into manufactured goods and other modern goods.
By capturing growing world market shares in manufactured goods and other non-commodities, these countries have expanded domestic employment to particularly productive activities.
As well as seeking good fundamentals (such as macroeconomic stability and outward orientation), their governments have pursued what might be termed productivist policies: undervalued currencies, industrial policies and financial controls.
China exemplifies this approach.
Its growth has been driven by an exceptionally rapid structural shift to increasingly sophisticated manufactured goods.
In recent years, China has also run a large trade surplus with the US, the equivalent of its undervalued currency.
However, China is not an isolated case.
Countries that achieved high economic growth in the run-up to the Great Crash of 2008 typically ran trade surpluses (or very small deficits).
These countries were not interested in becoming recipients of large capital inflows, because they knew that this would have a devastating effect on their much-needed ability to keep their currencies competitive.
It is now widely accepted that high foreign contributions, typified by the bilateral trade relationship between the US and China, contributed significantly to the Great Crash.
Global macroeconomic stability requires that we avoid such large current account imbalances in the future.
However, a return to high growth by developing countries will require them to resume their push into tradable goods and services.
In the past, this push has been driven by the willingness of the US and some other developed countries to run large trade deficits.
This is no longer a viable strategy for high-to-middle-income developing countries.
So are the requirements of global macroeconomic stability and economic growth in developing countries contradictory?
Will developing countries "need to generate large increases in the supply of industrial products inevitably conflict with our world's intolerance of trade imbalances?
In fact, there is no inherent conflict here, provided we understand that the size of their trade surpluses and even the volume of their exports are not important for growth in developing countries.
What is important is their output of modern manufactured goods (and services), which can increase indefinitely as long as domestic demand increases in parallel.
Having an undervalued currency has the advantage of subsidizing the manufacture of such goods, but it also has the disadvantage of burdening domestic consumption, which is why it generates a trade surplus.
By directly promoting industrial production, one can enjoy the advantage without having to accept the disadvantage.
There are many ways in which this can be done, including reducing the cost of domestic inputs and services through targeted investment in infrastructure.
An explicit industrial policy can be an even more effective instrument.
The key point is that developing countries, worried about the competitiveness of their modern sectors, can afford to allow their currencies to appreciate (in real terms) as long as they have access to alternative approaches that more directly promote industrial activity.
So the good news is that strong growth in developing countries is still possible, even as world trade slows and the propensity for capital flows and trade imbalances diminishes.
Their growth potential need not be seriously affected as long as the implications of this new world for domestic and international policies are understood.
One such implication is that developing countries must pursue a real industrial policy, rather than one that operates through the exchange rate.
Another is that external policy actors (such as the World Trade Organization) must be more tolerant of such policies, as long as the impact on trade balances is offset by appropriate adjustments in the real exchange rate.
Increased use of industrial policy is the price we must pay for the reduction of macroeconomic imbalances.
A decade of Hugo Chávez
SAN JOSE - We should have known something was wrong when President Hugo Chávez swore on Venezuela's 40-year-old constitution at his inauguration on February 2, 1999, calling it "moribund."
Under the moribund constitution, Venezuela had not only experienced eight peaceful presidential changes, but had also benefited from the fruits of democratic pluralism and strong civil and political freedoms.
While Venezuela produced as much corruption and political irresponsibility as barrels of oil during that time, it was still doing much better than the average Latin American country.
It was not Switzerland, but it was a true democracy by all standards.
That is now over.
Elections are still being held, but the legacy of ten years of Chávez is, above all else, the abolition of democratic institutions.
Chávez, elected in a landslide victory to clean up the previous establishment's political vices, chose to throw the baby out with the bathwater.
While the previous government, and with it its system of checks and balances and tradition of political tolerance, disappeared, its vices, especially abuse of office and demagoguery, became worse than ever.
Just as 10 years ago, Venezuela, once a destination for immigrants from around the world, remains underdeveloped.
More fundamentally, Chávez espouses ideas that have long stifled Latin America's political and economic growth.
This includes the idea that social justice can only be achieved by abandoning the path of reform and rejecting bourgeois democratic forms in favour of a real democracy born of revolutionary purity and the millennial dreams of the ruler.
This is simply wrong.
Although Chávez's revolution has made progress against poverty and inequality, it is barely sustainable and smacks of cronyism.
Indeed, similar achievements can be found in Chile and Brazil, which have not abandoned democratic control, political pluralism, or freedom of the press, and have not enjoyed the luxury of $300 billion in oil revenues in a decade.
Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that Venezuela itself reduced extreme poverty from 43% to 8% of the population between 1950 and 1980, one of the lowest figures in Latin America.
It has achieved this with democracy and freedom.
Moreover, Chávez repeats, ad nauseam, the view that others are to blame for Latin America's ills.
This is the damaging story, still very popular at universities across Latin America, that the late Venezuelan journalist Carlos Rangel eloquently refuted in books such as The West and the Third World.
It is clear that Yankee imperialism is not to blame for Venezuela's emaciated tax system, terribly poor schools, rampant corruption, high crime statistics, and weak political institutions.
In all these areas, Venezuela performs poorly, even by Latin America's low standards.
This is particularly true of the weakness of the institutions.
When Chavez calls a legitimate constitution "moribund," or proclaims it by introducing a state holiday to commemorate his 10th anniversary in office, we see telling examples of a home-made institutional farce that would condemn any country to the ninth circle of misery.
Of course, none of these views would succeed in a satisfied nation.
In this sense, Venezuela's experience extends to the whole of Latin America.
The combination of economic growth (now in decline due to the global crisis), ghastly inequality, and social segmentation will continue to produce the same unfulfilled expectations and social tensions that paved Chávez's path to power.
Until Latin American democracies take seriously the task of reducing inequality, expanding equal opportunities, and promoting greater social cohesion, they will continue to challenge disaster.
In order to prevent this outcome, it is imperative to exorcise certain reactionary and paralysing beliefs, such as the idea that reducing poverty eliminates the need to tackle inequality, or that development is possible without introducing modern and progressive tax systems.
If Chavez's tenth anniversary in office can serve as a reminder of the perils that surround unjust democracies, especially now that a new election cycle is looming in Latin America, then Venezuela's painful recent history would at least be made up for.
A Declaration of Independence from the US
George W. Bush is obsessed with the war on terrorism and, in particular, the military response to terrorism.
This obsession is reflected in American foreign policy.
This year, including the costs of the Iraq war, the US will spend about $450 billion on the military, while it will spend no more than $15 billion to overcome global poverty, environmental degradation, and disease.
In other words, spending on American foreign policy focuses 30 times more on the military than on ensuring global prosperity, global public health, and sustainable environmental protection.
Throughout 2003, the world has had to live with Bush's obsession.
The debate over Iraq dominated international diplomacy, occupying almost the entire United Nations agenda.
The war in Iraq cost countless innocent lives, for example in the bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad.
At the same time, President Bush's one-dimensional, militaristic approach to global problems has exacerbated unrest and instability throughout the Islamic world, leading to an increase in terrorist attacks in Turkey, North Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Southeast Asia.
This narrow strategy can hardly be justified by the nature of global suffering.
Focusing on terrorism to the exclusion of other problems and emphasising the military response to them will not lead to prosperity and peace, not even to a significant reduction in the number of attacks.
While 3,000 innocent people died in the US on September 11, 2001, 8,000 innocent children die of malaria every day in Africa.
Malaria is preventable and treatable.
The problem is that most of Africa is too poor to use the contraceptive and treatment methods (bed nets and malaria drugs) that could save millions of children every year.
The US spends more money in one day in Iraq than it does in an entire year to fight malaria in Africa.
As 2003 draws to a close, it is time for world leaders to help the world move away from the American government's obsessive, doomed policies.
President Bush should be made to understand that the US will not find genuine international support as long as America keeps talking about terrorism while doing next to nothing about the problems that really affect most of the world: poverty, lack of access to clean water and hygiene, vulnerability to disease, and climate change.
Ironically, President Bush claims that the United Nations is not translating its words into action.
He said recently in London that "the credibility of the UN depends on its willingness to keep its word and act when necessary."
But the US consistently violates its own promises to the United Nations.
For example, at the United Nations Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico, in March 2002, the US signed the Monterrey Consensus, which includes a promise by rich countries to increase their development assistance to 0.7% of national income.
That would mean an additional $60 billion a year in foreign aid from the US - roughly what the country has spent in Iraq this year.
But President Bush has so far simply ignored that promise.
There are many other similar commitments that the US has made to the United Nations in recent years that have remained completely unfulfilled.
As a signatory to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in 1992, the US promised action to combat man-made climate change.
Nothing has happened so far.
America also promised - in the Doha Declaration of 2001 - to open its markets to the world's poorest countries.
In Cancun, Mexico, last summer, it even refused to open its markets to exports from distressed African countries.
The list goes on and on.
At the Millennium Assembly in 2000, the US promised to tackle global poverty, but so far it has taken few steps in that direction.
At the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002, America committed itself to protecting global ecosystems, but to date, little has been seen or heard of American policy on the issue.
America is certainly not the only country failing to promote the international objectives adopted by the United Nations.
But, because the US is the richest and most powerful country in the world, this failure is devastating.
If the US really wants to root out terrorism, it must recognize the interconnectedness of extremism, poverty, and environmental degradation, and learn to understand the struggle for survival that is taking place among the world's poor.
But the world should not wait for America to come to its senses.
The US accounts for only 5% of the world's population, and it represents only one voice in the UN General Assembly.
Poor countries, especially the developing world's democracies - Brazil, South Africa, India, Mexico, Ghana, and the Philippines - should proclaim, "We must address the problems that concern us, not just those that concern the US."
What the world needs most in 2004 is a declaration of independence from American obstinacy.
A democratic Burma?
TOKYO Historical upheavals often occur when you least expect them.
Mikhail Gorbachev's liberating policy of glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union emerged from one of the darkest hours of the Cold War, when US President Ronald Reagan pushed strategic missile defense and the two sides fought proxy wars in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
Deng Xiaoping's economic opening came in 1978 after the bloody and failed Chinese invasion of Vietnam.
And South Africa's last apartheid leader, F. W. de Klerk, was initially seen as just another apologist for the system and hardly the man who would liberate Nelson Mandela and usher in the end of white minority rule.
And now, suddenly, the world is wondering whether Burma (Myanmar), after six decades of military rule, is heading for a real political transformation that could liberate the country from its outlawed status.
Can Burma really rise above half a century of self-imposed isolation, as South Africa did under de Klerk?
And can Aung San Suu Kyi, the heroic opposition leader, and Thein Sein, Burma's new president, achieve a political transition as skilful and peaceful as de Klerk did for South Africa in the early 1990 "s?
Despite two decades of house arrest and isolation, Suu Kyi possesses two of the qualities that helped Mandela accomplish his great task: a calming serenity and a complete absence of vindictiveness.
In the course of attempted reforms, these characteristics, together with their negotiating skills and, above all, their enormous moral authority, will be tested as never before.
Moreover, unlike Mandela during his 27 years in captivity, Suu Kyi's hopes have been repeatedly raised and dashed.
In the mid-1990 "s, and again in 2002-2003, the country seemed on the verge of reconciliation between Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) and the military junta.
Time and again, however, the regime's hardliners seized power again, destroying prospects for reform.
Nonetheless, Suu Kyi and much of the Burmese opposition are beginning to believe that current political liberalization could be sustainable.
Since Burma's generals rarely speak publicly, it is hard to understand why they facilitated elections that brought Thein Sein to power, or why they engaged in dialogue with the long-repressed opposition.
Recent events suggest a possible explanation: Burmese leaders are increasingly wary of China's crushing embrace of a result of the country's international isolation.
Indeed, public protests against China's exploitation of Burmese natural resources grew so much that the government stopped construction of the Myitsone Dam on the Irrawaddy River, run by Chinese investors.
Thein Sein's decision to halt the project represents an important political change.
It is also a signal to the outside world that the new Burmese Government could be much more open than its predecessors to public and international opinion, both of which had vehemently opposed the construction of the dam.
Almost at the same time, Thein Sein gave even more reason to believe that his government stands for change: he freed political prisoners and invited Suu Kyi to face-to-face talks.
Indeed, Suu Kyi now enjoys far greater freedom of movement than at any time since she won the Nobel Peace Prize twenty years ago, and the NLD recently announced that it would nominate candidates for the next elections to the country's newly constituted parliament.
If Suu Kyi is allowed to run freely for her seat in parliament and for her NLD colleagues, it would be clear that Thein Sein and his government really do intend to bring the country out of the shadows.
Any steps taken by Suu Kyi and Thein Sein from now on will be difficult and must be carried out with the same care and deliberation that Mandela and de Klerk showed in bridging their differences and guiding their country out of isolation.
But the international community must also proceed very cautiously.
While Thein Sein would no doubt like to see the reams of economic and political sanctions against Burma lifted quickly, it is too early to fully lift these measures.
But the world should show that any clear move toward greater political openness will be rewarded with greater political and economic engagement.
One positive sign that the world is gradually following Thein Sein is the Japan Investment Bank's intention to invest in the development of Burmese ports, which is fundamental to opening up the economy.
US President Barack Obama's decision to send his Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, to Burma for talks with Thein Sein is also a clear sign of the world's willingness to end the country's isolation.
Closer to home, ASEAN's recent declaration to give Burma a chance to chair the organization in 2014 underscores neighboring countries "desire to share fully in Asia's growing wealth.
We should not jump to conclusions, but Thein Sein's decisions so far are very similar to those of de Klerk in South Africa's reform process.
Fortunately, Burma already has its own Nelson Mandela in Aung San Suu Kyi.
An unexpected democratic stroke of luck for Turkey?
The fact that Turkey appears to have fallen out of favor with the US may yet turn out to be an unexpected boon.
The Iraq war and the tense diplomacy that preceded it could help resolve Turkey's conflict between its "strategic alliance" with America and its drive to become an EU member.
Last November's elections, which put the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in power, were preceded by a dispute between members of the then-ruling coalition over the regulation of reforms demanded by the EU.
Some liberal parts of this "secular" coalition left the government and joined forces with the Islamists to push the reforms through parliament.
AKP leaders, former Islamists who had reinvented themselves as "conservative democrats," engaged energetically with the US, the EU, and the UN on issues ranging from Cyprus to Iraq, Kurdish language rights, and other human rights issues within Turkey.
The AKP had suffered from the repressive practices of the "secular" state of Turkey, recognised the need to protect human rights in general, and emerged as a credible interlocutor with the West.
The US, fixated on the specter of a "clash of civilizations" between Islam and the Western world, saw an opportunity in the AKP's modern, westernized appearance and urged the EU to admit Turkey.
Today, both "conservative democrats" and liberals are campaigning for the adoption of all the reforms needed to join the EU, including extreme nationalists from both the left and the right, as well as sections of the "secular" establishment.
Europeans could have tipped the balance in favor of reformers by finally rewarding the efforts of the pro-EU Turks at the EU summit last December.
Instead, the EU made Turkey wait again, postponing formal negotiations that were likely to take years anyway.
Europe's continuing reluctance puts the Turks in an awkward position.
The US wants full EU membership for Turkey, a longtime NATO member and close American ally, while Europeans complain about the domestic role of the Turkish military.
Paradoxically, if Europe maintains political distance, thereby limiting Turkey's options, it can ultimately affirm Turkey's status as a US military outpost.
In any case, that was how things began to unfold before the Iraq War began.
But then, despite massive US pressure, the Turkish parliament unexpectedly rejected the government's request for US troops to invade Turkey from Turkish soil.
Turkey's refusal to allow the Americans access to military bases on its territory has effectively prevented a northern front in the war.
The Turkish government even attempted a regional initiative for a peaceful resolution of the conflict, an effort that none of the current EU members could have contemplated.
Parliament's rejection of US troops clearly refutes suggestions that Turkey was primarily concerned about the size of the American aid package offered as an incentive to cooperate.
Presumptions that interpreted the vote as a revelation of the true "Islamist" nature of the government ignore the fact that the only opposition party in parliament, the Republican People's Party of Ataturk, was founded and still voted "secular" through and through against the project.
Other parts of Turkey's secular establishment, including the president and military leadership, also either rejected the idea of war in Iraq, or were moderately enthusiastic at best.
Initially, the Turkish military did not comment on this issue and, quite uncharacteristically, observed the development of the civil political process.
By contrast, the military had previously publicly criticized ACP initiatives on Cyprus.
His silence on Iraq reflected his fears about undesirable alternatives: either support the US plan and risk encouraging Kurdish activity toward an independent state, or oppose the Americans and jeopardize an important strategic relationship.
They decided to leave it to the civilian leadership and parliament, which, by rejecting the American plan, reflected the overwhelming public opposition to the war.
Only after the vote did the chief of staff publicly support the original proposal to bring in American troops.
Indeed, the supposedly Islamic party has managed to negotiate skilfully with a relentless US, consult with the Turkish military and president, and pass on all information to the public and parliament.
In a situation in which there was really nothing to gain, the party leadership has moved to a narrow degree, clarifying the interests and prudently leaving the final decision to Parliament.
The result was a victory for Turkish democracy that was internationally recognised as such.
After the American military intervention in Iraq, the tide may turn surprisingly.
As America establishes itself in Iraq, Turkey's geopolitical military importance may diminish.
Nevertheless, the stated American goal of building a Muslim democracy in Iraq only increases Turkey's symbolic importance as a role model.
This shift in Turkey's strategic role can also translate into a new balance within Turkey between the military and the forces driving reform.
If handled prudently, Turkey can move closer to Europe while rebuilding its relationship with America.
A Devaluation Alternative for Southern Europe
CAMBRIDGE - This year is likely to be the test of fire for the euro.
The survival of the eurozone requires a credible solution to its ongoing sovereign debt crisis, which in turn requires addressing the two macroeconomic imbalances in external and fiscal policy that lie at the heart of that crisis.
The crisis has laid bare the deep differences in competitiveness that have emerged in the eurozone.
Between 1996 and 2010, unit labour costs rose by a mere 8% in Germany and 13% in France.
This compares with 24% in Portugal, 35% in Spain, 37% in Italy and a huge 59% in Greece.
The result is large trade imbalances among eurozone countries, a problem exacerbated by large budget deficits and high public debt in southern Europe (and France) to a large extent to foreign lenders.
Will resolving these imbalances require a break-up of the eurozone?
Suppose, for example, that Portugal were to leave the eurozone and reintroduce the escudo.
The resulting exchange-rate depreciation would immediately lower the price of Portuguese exports, boost the economy, and provide much-needed growth.
But an exit from the euro would be a messy affair.
The resulting turbulence could well wipe out all the competitive advantages resulting from devaluation.
There is a remarkably simple alternative that would not require the troubled economies of southern Europe to abandon the euro and devalue their exchange rates.
This would require an increase in VAT and, at the same time, a reduction in non-wage labour costs.
Our recent research shows that such a devaluation has a very similar impact on the economy than fiscal policy in terms of its impact on GDP, consumption, employment and inflation.
Currency devaluation works by making imports more expensive and exports cheaper.
Increasing VAT while cutting non-wage labour costs would do exactly the same.
Increasing VAT raises the price of imported goods, as foreign firms have to pay higher taxes.
To ensure that domestic firms have no incentive to raise prices, an increase in VAT must go hand in hand with a reduction in non-wage labour costs.
Moreover, because exports are exempt from VAT, the price of domestic exports is now falling.
The desired impact on the competitiveness of exchange rate depreciation must therefore also be achieved while maintaining the euro.
This policy can also help on the fiscal front.
Just as with exchange-rate depreciation, the positive effects of increasing competitiveness on growth can improve the budgetary position by increasing tax revenues.
Moreover, a major advantage of fiscal depreciation is that it generates additional revenues proportional to the country's trade deficit.
For countries that suffer from low competitiveness and therefore run trade deficits, this usually means more revenue, especially in the short term.
As with exchange-rate depreciation, there are winners and losers in fiscal depreciation.
Both act as a levy on assets: inflation means that bondholders suffer a real loss proportional to the size of their assets and the extent of the depreciation.
And if taxes on capital are not adjusted, holders of domestic shares will suffer a comparable loss.
By contrast, many transfers, such as unemployment benefits, health insurance benefits and state pensions, are linked to inflation and therefore retain their real value.
The same goes for the minimum wage.
These distributional effects play an important political role in exchange-rate devaluations, and most of these effects also occur in fiscal devaluations.
Fiscal devaluations already have some advocates.
Indeed, French President Nicolas Sarkozy's government has just announced one.
And concerns that such a devaluation would run counter to euro rules can be addressed simply by pointing out that in 2007, the German government did a U-turn, albeit under a different name, when it raised VAT from 16% to 19% and cut employer National Insurance contributions from 6.5% to 4.2%.
In short, there are simple fiscal alternatives to exchange-rate depreciation that can solve southern Europe's short-term competitiveness problems.
To be sure, feasible fiscal devaluations would be limited in scope.
But, combined with debt restructuring, accommodative monetary policy, liquidity support from the European Central Bank, and much-needed structural reforms, they can help put troubled economies back on a sound footing, without the euro breaking up or a major austerity-driven recession.
Cloudy Light on Global Warming
COPENHAGEN - Amid a growing wave of concern about climate change, many countries, including Brazil, Australia, the United States and European Union members, passed laws in the 2000s banning or severely restricting access to light bulbs.
Their intention was understandable: if everyone in the world swapped most of their incandescent bulbs for energy-saving compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), we could save 3.5% of total electricity consumption, or 1% of our CO2 emissions.
The recent attempt by Republicans in the US Congress to reverse America's efforts to ban incandescent bulbs has revived that debate.
Many claim that the agenda is being driven by primitive climate-change deniers.
But it is worth taking a closer look at the premise that banning things is the smartest way to combat global warming.
Let us be clear: we must do something to combat climate change.
But that does not mean that we should simply give up all emissions.
There are also significant benefits to burning fossil fuels, and we should weigh those benefits against the costs.
A carbon tax should do the damage.
By best estimates, this is about seven dollars per ton of CO2, or 0.06 dollars per gallon of gasoline (0.015 euros per liter).
Most developed countries already levy a tax at this level (and often much higher) on electricity and fossil fuels, but it also includes the costs of air pollution and supply insecurity.
While CFLs are much more expensive to buy, they are also much cheaper over their lifetime, because they consume much less electricity (and even cheaper when carbon costs are factored into taxes on electricity consumption).
Therefore, on a direct cost-benefit basis, it makes sense for most people to switch from light bulbs to new, greener technology.
That is the great thing about technological solutions to climate change: if an alternative solution is cheaper, people will start using it.
My household uses CFLs, and I feel good knowing that I emit less CO2 and save money.
So why is it necessary to ban the old light bulbs?
The reason is that monetary costs are only one factor.
Many people find it annoying that CFLs need time to warm up.
Or they think their light is funny.
Or they worry that CFLs release toxic mercury when they break up.
In some people, energy-saving lights can trigger epileptic seizures and migraines.
The upfront costs are also a factor, especially for those on low incomes.
And in places where bulbs are not used very often, a cheaper bulb can cost less overall than its energy-saving alternative.
You might think that people could choose the right bulbs for them themselves.
But advocates of a phased ban on access to light bulbs argue that they know better.
As U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu put it recently, "We're eliminating a freedom of choice that would continue to allow people to waste their money."
Leaving aside other possible objections to this view, the problem is that it assumes that all light bulbs are worth less than $7 per tonne of CO2.
This is clearly not the case for people who suffer from migraines or epileptic seizures as a result of the new bulbs, or who are seriously concerned about mercury, or who prefer light bulbs for other reasons.
The solution should be to focus on improving the technology by making the new bulbs safer and brighter, and making sure they warm up faster and save more energy so people can replace them more with light bulbs.
But it's not just light bulbs that politicians are trying to ban.
The European Parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of banning patio heaters, a luxury the planet cannot afford, according to one MP.
Who decides when something is a luxury?
And where will it end?
Should we ban air conditioning or satellite TV because some people see it as a luxury?
Should we ban private cars wherever public transport is available to get us from point A to point B with lower CO2 emissions?
It makes sense that the price you pay to drive a car or heat your patio reflects the cost of CO2 (among many other factors), but if it takes longer to remove something from circulation than some parliamentarians would like, banning it is not the right solution.
Real reductions in carbon emissions will occur when better technologies make it worthwhile for consumers and businesses to change their behavior.
CFLs and other advances may go some way, but there are massive technological hurdles to overcome before fossil fuels generally become less attractive than greener alternatives.
This is where a lot of politicians make a mistake.
Our governments talk far too much about imposing a relatively high carbon tax on emissions and focus far too little on accelerating research and development to bring about the necessary breakthroughs.
Restricting access to the wrong light bulbs or patio heaters is ultimately not the way to go.
We will only be able to solve the problem of global warming by ensuring that alternative technologies are better than what we currently have.
Then people all over the world will decide to use them.
A doomsday scenario
As America squabbles over whether or not to invade Iraq, fears are beginning to creep into the debate about whether it could stall the country's economic recovery, while growing concerns about the state of the global economy.
It is agreed that there is a large gap between the growth potential of the US economy and how it is actually operating and that this gap will remain open for a long time to come.
Can the situation get any worse?
Yes, it can, and much worse!
There have long been a number of reasons to be concerned about the US economy:
Vast trade deficits have existed here since Ronald Reagan's misplaced tax cuts in 1981, making America, once the world's largest creditor, its largest debtor.
Today, these deficits are climbing month by month to new record highs.
America's appallingly low savings rate.
When Americans "wealth seemed to increase year by year with stock values, this was understandable; the individual American became richer without saving, so why worry?
Today's saving rate in America, though it has picked up somewhat, is still low, under the table of the world's savings masters.
Label accounting standards.
The Arthur Anderson, Enron, and WorldCom scandals were not just hot air. They arose in the mid-1990 "s, when the US Treasury actually intervened to stop attempts to improve those things that the supposedly independent Accounting Standards Committee had set in motion.
Poor accounting contributed to the recent stock bubble; bad information led to stock prices that did not reflect the reality that underpins them; these prices then encouraged excessive investment in the telecom sector, which in turn led to today's excess capacity.
New ingredients were added to this old brew, triggering the most abrupt upheaval in a country's financial situation the world has ever seen.
In a swift turn like the "Look here, now it's gone," which magicians rejoice in, the $3 trillion budget surplus projected for the next ten years (excluding Social Security reserves) turned into a gaping $2 trillion deficit in just a few months.
Of course, excuses were at hand: the magnitude of the economic slump could not be predicted, and the excessive effort to combat terrorism could not be predicted.
Excuses, nothing but excuses!
As the old saying goes, "Don't count on your chicks until they hatch!"
But the Bush administration not only booked these chicks, it had already sold them in advance.
It was clear to anyone with a reasonably clear view that the whitewashed budget projections of two years ago were utter nonsense.
It was also clear that the Bush administration, with its tax cuts, had engaged in the same accounting falsifications (only on a multibillion-dollar scale) as Enron's dishonest accounting.
But how can things get any worse when things are already so bad?
Here's a likely scenario:
To finance its trade deficit, America must pump more than $1 billion a day abroad.
As long as America offered investors from around the world the only safe haven, it succeeded easily.
But America today seems far less secure.
The combination of a lack of confidence in US firms "accounting, a lack of confidence in America's economic governance (accompanied by a ballooning deficit), and signs of soft economic fundamentals has tarnished the US economy's good reputation.
As foreigners begin to withdraw their money from the country they distrust, the dollar weakens.
If the dollar weakens, America looks even more uncertain, and everyone runs as fast as they can to the exit.
A weak dollar may be good for exports, but the fall in the dollar will be compounded by stock falls and further loss of confidence.
Finally, even the all-powerful American consumer will be disconcerted to discover that he is poorer today than he was three years ago and that he would do well to set aside some extra money for his retirement, especially in view of Bush's daring experiments with social security.
At that point, Americans will join the flight from their own economy.
And why shouldn't they?
They are free to choose where to put their money.
Europe's stock markets are beginning to offer themselves as a promising alternative.
But such a scenario does not bring Europe a happy ending either.
A weakening US economy and a strengthening euro will cause European exports to slump.
The European Central Bank is so fixated on inflation that it will be slow to cut interest rates, and the European Stability Pact makes it impossible for fiscal policy to deal with this weakness.
Europe will join America's economic slowdown, exacerbating the overall economic downturn and setting in motion a downward spiral worldwide.
I'm not saying that has to happen.
I hope the Bush administration will take action to reinvigorate the US economy: tax cuts that might have made sense while the US seemed to be running a multi-billion dollar budget surplus no longer make sense.
The Bush administration should acknowledge this and revise its tax program to strengthen the economy by limiting the country to the limits of its capabilities.
On top of that, President Bush could strengthen the economy with better unemployment benefits, providing the stimulus needed if the downturn continues.
America is strong, and so is the global economy.
If the unfortunate events we have hinted at occur, a new global economy like the phoenix will have to rise from the ashes.
Of course, economic downturns are not always entirely avoidable, but we can limit their frequency; we can mitigate them and ensure that fewer people are affected and that those affected are better protected.
Unfortunately, we are doing less than is possible to prevent another crash, and we are doing less than is necessary to protect ourselves from the consequences.
Is the US in a two-stage recession?
As recently as last winter, America's central bank - the Federal Reserve Bank - was busy patting itself on the back.
The lowering of the Bundesbank's key interest rate to 1.75% per annum seemed to show success in bringing the recession to an end.
Despite more sober expectations about the impact of the high-tech revolution on productivity and profits, and despite the fear sparked by the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, it was believed that American companies would soon start investing again on a large scale, because borrowing money at 1.75% interest was too good a deal to miss.
But by the end of spring, those expectations had evaporated after the collapse of Enron, WorldCom, and Arthur Andersen.
Suddenly, everyone doubted the accuracy of American companies "financial reports.
Suddenly, everyone noticed how much America's system of corporate supervision and control had deteriorated during the financial bubble economy of the 1990 "s.
The American stock exchange fell 15-20% below its winter level.
The gap between the interest rate at which the US government could borrow and the rate at which American firms could borrow continued to widen.
And suddenly the Fed stopped congratulating itself: a rate of 1.75% may be the right rate to kick-start the recovery when the Dow Jones stock index stands at 10,000, but not when it reaches 8,500.
Over the summer, business investment news remained disappointing.
More and more analysts began talking about the possibility of a "two-stage" recession.
But throughout it all, the Fed did nothing.
The interest rates on short-term bonds for which it is responsible did not move.
As recently as mid-August, the Fed hinted that interest rates could be cut.
There were two sides to the official and unofficial reasons for the Fed's inaction.
1. Interest rates on short-term funds are already so low that any further reduction would only be considered temporary.
They would therefore have little impact on the long-term interest rates that actually drive business investment.
2. If short-term interest rates were already so low that further interest rate cuts would only unsettle the financial markets. If even the Fed thought that conditions demanded further interest rate cuts - so the argument goes - then firms would not respond with higher investments, but rather reduce them even further.
The Fed's assessment seemed to be that it was largely (if not completely) powerless; it had tried everything in its power, but the levers of fiscal policy were no longer intertwined enough to determine the level of economic activity.
Thus, in 2002, the US followed Japan into what economists had called a liquidity trap for 65 years: a situation in which nominal short-term interest rates, which the central bank could set, were so low and loosely linked to aggregate demand levels that further interest-rate cuts proved ineffective in combating the recession.
America's situation was not unique: Japan had been trapped in a liquidity trap since the mid-1990 "s.
But there had been no other example of this since the Great Depression of the 1930 "s.
Whether America is now in a liquidity trap is uncertain, as is how long it will last.
Even if America were only on the verge of a liquidity trap, and if it were to move out of its current state soon, this remains a frightening situation.
If monetary policy proves ineffective, the only lever left for the US government to regain control of its economy is fiscal policy: to modify the government's taxes and spending plans in such a way that it affects the government's direct contribution to aggregate demand.
But the lesson of the decades since World War II is that the US government, with its complicated, baroque, eighteenth-century organization, is incapable of changing policy quickly enough to effectively manage tax policy as an economic tool.
Quite simply, it takes too long for tax and spending changes to make their way through Congress and the bureaucracy.
An America trapped in a liquidity trap is - quite simply - a country without effective macroeconomic management tools.
Since World War II, there have been two phases in which policymakers - at least American policymakers - believed that they had solved the conundrum of business cycles and learned how to manage a modern, industrial, or post-industrial economy.
The first phase determined the policy of the Keynesian flood-level gauge of the 1960s, full of confidence in demand management.
It became ineffective with inflation during the Vietnam War and the oil price shocks of the 1970 "s.
The second was the decade of successful management of business cycles by Alan Greenspan's independent, apolitical, and technocratic Fed during the 1990 "s.
This second phase is now proving to be as temporary as the first.
Eighty years ago, John Maynard Keynes claimed that - governments must take responsibility for full employment and price stability; - the pre-World War I gold standard era was not the healing world people thought it was; - and that its success owes much more to a happy confluence of circumstances that is unlikely to be repeated.
Keynes was an optimist when he believed that governments could learn to manage business cycles.
He would be shocked if he saw the world today: a Europe with unchanged high unemployment, a Japan that has been stuck in stagnation for a decade, an America without the political tools to deal with any more unexpected economic woes.
The Netherlands - a model for Brazil?
The successful return of Brazil to international financial markets at the end of April and the strengthening of the local currency, the Real, have shown that the election of President Luiz Inácio da Silva (Lula) has not caused a breakdown in foreign confidence.
Nevertheless, recent positive developments must not obscure the need for structural economic reforms.
Lula knows that progress in this area, as well as in reforming the labour market, will be crucial to ensuring sufficient economic growth in Brazil to enable him to implement his ambitious social reforms.
Crucial will be how Lula, a former metal worker and founding member of Brazil's CUT trade union federation, will shape relations with these unions, which also represent workers in the automotive industry.
The recent strikes at the Brazilian plants of General Motors, Renault, Volvo and Ford do not bode well.
Tax and Social Security reforms presented to Congress at the end of April appear to be exacerbating tensions.
To see how to combine high growth rates with job creation in a socially acceptable way, Lula should take a look at Europe.
He could also see how some politicians have evolved from leftist opponents of the market to reform-minded leaders.
Felipe González in Spain and Tony Blair in Britain have undergone such a transformation.
Perhaps an even better example is Wim Kok, who resigned last year after eight years as Dutch Prime Minister.
Lula and Kok are linked by their unusual history, which led them to the highest office in government via the union presidency.
As the head of the largest Dutch trade union FNV, Kok had considerable influence on Dutch economic policy.
During his tenure as union leader in the late 1970 "s and early 1980" s, the Dutch economy was in prolonged crisis, characterized by stagnation, high unemployment, enormous interest rates, and poor corporate earnings.
Large budget deficits discouraged private investors.
Holland's problems were mainly structural, but a cyclical downturn exacerbated the situation.
By 1982 the situation had deteriorated to such an extent that the "social partners" in the Dutch tripartite system (government, representatives of business and trade unions) agreed that the only way to overcome the crisis was to break with the past.
The decisive moment came with the Wassenaar Agreement in 1982, a pact between employers and trade unions that came about with the active support of the government.
In return for reduced working hours and improved prospects for the future, the unions agreed to moderate wage demands and to abandon indexation of wages.
The increasing flexibility of the Dutch labour market eventually led to an improvement in the profitability of companies and to rapid job creation. The rate of growth was the highest in Europe and comparable to that of the United States.
Prudent fiscal policies in times of economic recovery and falling interest rates created scope for large tax cuts and welfare savings.
A lower rate of inflation increased the actual income available to workers, which in turn gave union leaders an opportunity to show their members that wage moderation was in their interest.
The recent much weaker performance of the Dutch economy is largely due to strong wage increases, which have reduced competitiveness and contributed to job losses.
These developments prompted Kok last year - on the 20th anniversary of the Wassenaar Agreement - to call for a new pact between the country's social partners.
He will soon have a Europe-wide platform to spread his message of wage moderation and labour market flexibility after he was appointed chair of a working group aimed at reinvigorating the EU Employment Strategy.
In what form is the Wassenaar Agreement now relevant for Brazil?
Like Holland in the early 1980 "s, Brazil's economy now faces the challenge of boosting employment in times of fiscal hardship and high interest rates.
Although Brazil's unemployment rates are not very high by regional standards, a growing labor force requires many jobs to be created.
Following the Dutch path of job creation would be the surest way for Brazil to alleviate population poverty.
The idea is not that Brazil should adopt the socio-economic model of the Netherlands - the differences between the two countries are too great for that.
But Lula could and should follow Coke's example and use his union connections and good relations with workers to achieve a social pact aimed at sustainably improving Brazil's overall economic performance and harnessing its potential as Latin America's economic engine.
Since Lula's election, Brazil has benefited from improved financial indicators and a more positive market sentiment.
Now the Brazilian government should initiate a Wassenaar-style agreement to guarantee social peace.
This could give the government leeway to pursue its many long-term competitiveness-enhancing policy objectives, including major reform of the costly pension system, a fundamental overhaul of the tax system, and strengthening the legal framework for corporate bankruptcy.
Lula's countrymen, who overwhelmingly elected him, need rapid economic growth and job creation.
This will only happen if Lula succeeds in transforming himself from an opponent of the market and trade union leader to a statesman who sensibly combines economic and social reform.
Success would not only benefit Brazil; it would also set a strong example for Latin America as a whole.
One Europe for All
Long-established members of the European Union seem to have doubts about the future of the Union at the moment, whereas in Ukraine we look to the European Union with hope and admiration.
The fundamental objective of our foreign policy is to participate in the progress of the EU, because Ukraine has established that national unity is not the end, but a beginning.
European unity is indeed indivisible: if one nation is excluded, everyone is unfree.
We Europeans are inescapably caught in a web, our fates are interwoven.
Every aspect of our common culture, if not the last century of shared suffering, confirms this.
Where a European country is concerned directly, everyone is concerned indirectly.
We can never again afford the narrow notion of two Europe of the haves and have-nots, the elect and the outcast.
All those who live on the European continent cannot, indeed must not, remain excluded from the Union.
Today's great European peace and today's pan-European prosperity depend on it.
Of course, some people grumble that Ukraine is not Europe.
Let them come to Kiev and talk to the people, young and old, factory workers, peasant women, lawyers, doctors and teachers, who stood for weeks in the cold and snow last winter and persevered to defend their freedom.
Are they not linked to those who assisted General de Gaulle in the French resistance?
Are they not one with those who died fighting for the Spanish Republic in the 1930s, liberated Budapest in 1956, and ended fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970s?
Are they not inspired by the same spirit as Poland's Solidarity movement and the peaceful masses that gave rise to the Velvet Revolution in Prague in 1989?
This is the true European spirit, and no doubt it can be broken.
To those who think that Ukraine is too backward for EU membership, I say: let them, too, come to my country and see the mothers who stay at work late at night and explain to their children on their company computers how to use a computer.
They should go to language schools in every village and city where young people prepare for Europe by learning French, German and English. Those who doubt Ukraine's European outlook should understand that Europe is not a question of hardware and highways. It is an insatiable desire for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.
I believe that our future is as promising as Europe's past is proud of, and that we must not eke out our destiny as a forgotten borderland in a troubled region, but that we will help shape Europe's peace and unity as makers.
Self-determination is no longer synonymous with isolation, for attaining national independence today merely means returning to the world stage with a new status.
New nations can build a relationship with their former occupiers as fertile as France's with Germany, a relationship based on equality and mutual interests.
This is the kind of relationship my government is trying to build with Russia, and by achieving this we can contribute to the enlargement of the area of Europe where there is peace.
Of course, it is premature to do more than express the high esteem in which we hold the prospect of EU membership.
We know that our part in this great building will not be built overnight.
We know that the great achievements of European unification are not to be found in documents and declarations, but in innovative steps aimed at improving the lives of all Europeans and guaranteeing their security.
Building a Ukraine worthy of EU membership will not be easy, cheap, or quick.
But, like the EU itself, it will be built and completed.
We know that this is a great challenge, but the price is worth the effort, and Europe should know that this is our goal.
Ukraine's reconstruction effort consists in part of a creative struggle to end a nightmarish century in which fascism and communism, ideologies born in the heart of Europe, tried to prevail.
Only a few months ago, our children and parents in cities across Ukraine faced armed troops, snarling dogs and even death.
Only a few years ago, the young journalist Georgi Gongadze, who wanted to educate the public about the corruption of the old regime, was mistreated and beheaded by the regime's thugs.
But our Orange Revolution last winter shows that the Ukrainian people have won.
That is why, despite today's doubts and difficulties, I remain steadfast in my faith in Europe.
I refuse to accept despair as the last answer to Ukraine's confused and cruel history.
I refuse to accept the view that Ukraine is so tragically bound to the starless night of communist heritage that we can never see the bright dawn of peace and true European unity.
When EU citizens reflect on Ukraine's place in Europe, they should look behind the facade they see, but they should also look at it more closely.
They should look past the devastated wasteland caused by communism, past the poverty and social disparities with which our discarded former rulers tried to prolong their mismanagement.
Instead, they should look at the face of our President Viktor Yushchenko, disfigured by a poison attack during last year's election campaign, and recall the words of the great Frenchman André Malraux, for whom <unk> considers the most beautiful faces are those who have been injured.
A Europe of provinces, not states
These days, the European Constitutional Convention is meeting to debate in detail the future of the EU institutions; reason enough to reflect on the unthinkable: where is Europe heading?
Or perhaps another question should be asked, namely: what would be a sensible solution for the future of Europe?
After the collapse of communism, many small states emerged in Europe.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were restored after the Soviet occupation.
Czechoslovakia disintegrated into two independent states.
Yugoslavia sacked Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia and may soon spit out Kosovo and Montenegro.
Although the Baltic republics merely restored their pre-World War II independence, and the breakup of Yugoslavia was a bloody affair, like so many wars of independence, there is something seductively new in all this.
In the years between the wars, the Baltic states were often seen as impractical creations of the great powers.
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia came into being because their individual components were regarded as non-viable states.
Why was that?
Because 80 years ago, when Wilson, Clemenceau and Lloyd George redrew the map of Europe, small states were too weak both in war and in peace.
To survive, a state had to be large enough to defend itself and to build a relatively independent economy.
None of this is true today.
With the prospect of accession to the EU, the importance of national markets is dwindling.
Membership of the EU or NATO makes war among European member states unthinkable, and all NATO members would react to an attack on even the smallest NATO member.
In the absence of such external threats, ties between the Czechs and Slovaks (not to mention Serbs and Croats!) proved too weak to form the basis for a common national government.
Does this tell us anything about the future of Europe as a whole?
What distinguishes Czechoslovakia from Italy or Germany is scarcely more than 50 years.
Wasn't Italy a collection of kingdoms and principalities until the 1860s?
Wasn't the unification of Germany a matter of "blood and iron"?
France and Spain are older, but is the bond between Basques, Catalans, or Corsicans with their respective nation states so much happier than the bond between Czechs and Slovaks was?
Is there really so much in favour of Scots and Welsh sharing a nation state with the English?
Let us distance ourselves for a moment from the idea of French, German or Italian identity, of patriotism, of the collective memory of war and slaughter that have cemented the consciousness of today's linguistic communities and ask ourselves the following question: why do Europeans need yet another layer of administration between the European Community administration and the local institutions?
Why do Piedmontese, Bavarians, or Scots need a national bureaucracy for their tax policies, welfare systems, security laws, and the largely useless armies that merely multiply their shortcomings?
Wouldn't life be much easier if the common market, the currency, foreign policy, an army and a few other things were managed at Community level and the rest transferred to more sensible local authorities?
It is all very well to poke fun at the bureaucratic tinkering of European regulation.
But the European regulatory frenzy is nothing compared to the mountains of national laws and decrees, the billions spent on political lobbying and the colossal state machines that swallow 30-40% of the economic product of the European nation states.
No European state, no matter how regulatory, could surpass that.
Indeed, the establishment of a European federal government and the abolition of the national intermediate stages would probably lead to the greatest liberalization of the economy (and of society as a whole) in European history.
Let us look at the America of 1787: the creation of the federal government put an end to the fragmented system of pre-revolutionary colonies and ushered in a new era of entrepreneurial expansion across the entire American continent.
The simple truth is that Europe as a whole is too diverse to be absorbed by the economic and political interest groups that dominate the nation states.
The EU seems cumbersome and bureaucratic because it is an additional layer of administration.
If it replaced national governments, its burden would be feather-light compared to what exists today.
Nations also prevent a balance within the Union.
Germany and Italy are simply too large compared to Portugal and Belgium (themselves a rather dubious conglomerate of Flemish and Walloon peoples), and this creates imbalances reminiscent of Prussia's hard hand in the old Bismarck empire.
Could a European federation replace today's national identities?
Could the French and the British identify internally with "Europe" just as much as with their nation states? Probably not.
But do they have to?
When Europeans think of future institutions, it is always about the tension between national differences and the common European identity.
But what if the common European institutions were not seen through the lens of the national institutions?
What if the European consciousness were to be further developed, not by transferring loyalty to a higher level, but by returning loyalties to smaller and more meaningful entities, thereby giving these entities a new meaning?
Of course, the end of nation states is not imminent, but not because they are so deeply rooted in their citizens "consciousness.
National identities are usually nothing more than simplistic abstractions, clichés, such as those of race, social class or other ideological creations.
Just think how much more real diversity there would be in a united Europe if the nation states did not get in the way.
But the nation states of Europe will not disappear any time soon, because they are all centres of power.
After all, forty cents of every euro of GDP is worth fighting for.
But if Europeans get a sense of where to go, the national identities forged over the last two hundred years (for they are not much older) may become like an appendix, the part of the human body responsible for little more than occasional inflammation.
A women's Europe?
PARIS - Are women in Europe on the verge of becoming the engine of political change?
In the field of economic development, experience and common sense suggest that progress, accountability, and hard work with women stand or fall.
Microcredit, for example, is much more effective if it is given to women and repaid by them.
Perhaps because they have children and need to feed them, women are now seen as the best and most determined pacesetters of change.
This now seems to be as true of European politics as it used to be of the economies of parts of Africa and Asia.
The outcome of Italy's recent municipal elections may be a sign of incipient electoral dynamics: Silvio Berlusconi's party was voted out of power by women in Milan, in a city that had long been under his control (and that was originally his center of power).
There is no direct link between this election result and the dramatic scandal surrounding Dominique Strauss-Kahn in New York, but immediately after DSK's arrest, Italian women and young voters mobilized massively against Berlusconi's party (which, ironically, is led by a woman in Milan).
Those voters were fed up with the mixture of machismo and slipperiness that once served the man Italian humorists now call "Berlus-Kahn."
When Berlusconi came to power 17 years ago, he had the support of a majority of women.
They were not discouraged by his ambivalent perception of the female sex (on one occasion he glorified their traditional domesticity and on another occasion he glorified their sexual objectification).
But Italian society has changed: today, most women are working and no longer willing to accept Berlusconi's anachronistic and incomprehensible chauvinism.
Italian men may feel sorry for the ageing, isolated leader who increasingly looks like his wax figure at Madame Tussaud's.
But Italian women (and, it seems, women in general) feel nothing but anger and humiliation at a man so consumed by himself, his various criminal trials, and his vulgar pleasures that he seems to have no choice but to remain in power for as long as possible.
Of course, women are not alone in opposing Berlusconi, but in Milan they were crucial to the election.
They embody modernity and are animated by the desire for dignity and respect.
Italians are not the only pioneers of a new Europe of women.
When Iceland went bankrupt because of the irresponsible behavior of its largely male political and financial elites, the Icelandic people decided that only a strong and responsible woman could overcome the country's problems.
That is why they elected a woman president.
The depth and scope of the current economic and social crisis in countries such as Greece, Portugal and Spain offer women new opportunities.
Faced with what many women see as an economic war, they are playing an increasingly important role in maintaining the financial security of their families.
And the more this phenomenon spreads, the more women will aspire to a role in politics commensurate with their economic influence.
This changing status of women may not translate directly into growing political influence.
And the rest of Europe may never follow the example of Scandinavia, where gender equality is much more advanced than elsewhere.
Yet such a dynamic now seems to be under way.
Similarly, regardless of the outcome of the trial in New York, the DSK case could mark a turning point in the treatment of women in Europe.
The public and private display of atavistic machismo will, one hopes, no longer be acceptable.
In the Arab world, too, young women from Tunis to Cairo have played an important role in the revolutionary process.
Their desire for change, understandable given the treatment of women in traditional Muslim societies, appears to have been one of the main drivers of the revolutionary impulse in Tunisia and Egypt.
None of this is to say that women as a whole are a universal force for positive change in Europe and around the world.
Think, for example, of Marine Le Pen, the new leader of the Front Nationale in France; of Elena Ceausescu, the greedy wife of the former Romanian dictator; or of Leila Trabelsi, the wife of Tunisian ex-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who fled to Dubai with 1.5 tons of gold, which she had taken with her from the Tunisian central bank.
The fact is that, with so many people demanding far-reaching changes in so many countries, equality policy is taking centre stage in Europe and beyond.
The big question is whether the growing number of women in politics is adopting the diverse perspectives and leadership styles that many voters (or protesters) crave.
European cure against the Balkan depression
VIENNA - European politics is largely shaped by historical events and anniversaries.
But, while such events are often unpredictable, anniversaries are different.
In five years' time, Europe will turn 100.
To mark the anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War, which led to an almost unprecedented loss of life and set in motion a chain of events that led to the creation of Europe as we know it today.
Perhaps world leaders have already reserved a few days in August 2014 to mark the occasion.
The presumption is that they will meet in Sarajevo to look back on Europe's brutal twentieth century.
But what will Sarajevo look like in five years?
Will it still be the capital of a country whose citizens face a bleak future and whose politicians have completely lost touch with the electorate?
Or is there hope that European leaders will use the anniversary to announce the successful accession of the remaining Balkan countries to the European Union?
A recent poll by Gallup Europe, called Balkan Monitor, reflects the current state of public opinion in Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and a decade after the end of the Kosovo war.
The results seem to indicate that the next few years will be crucial for the future development of the region.
Although the overwhelming majority of citizens are convinced that another armed conflict in the region is unlikely, the general mood remains pessimistic, with the exception of Kosovars and Albanians.
The future promises peace without development.
Trust in political elites and in national and European institutions is falling steadily.
The majority of citizens have seen their standard of living deteriorate in the last year and people continue to feel that they have more opportunities outside their own country.
Pessimism about the job market is alarmingly high among young people, while government corruption and mismanagement are seen as widespread.
All those who have made it their mission to boast of stability in the region should look at these figures.
It is indeed remarkable that the majority of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina believe that their politicians have no interest in their country's accession to the EU.
An absolute majority of citizens in each of the countries surveyed are convinced that their country is heading in the wrong direction.
Fewer than one in ten Croats (whose country could join the EU in the near future) believe that the country is moving in the right direction.
There are currently two options for the region: one is a shock integration programme involving all the Western Balkan states in the EU; the other is a journey into the unknown.
The hope that these countries can muddle through on their own is a dangerous illusion.
Stability alone can no longer be the EU's sole objective in the region.
The EU's continued presence as a colonial power in countries such as Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo could cause even more problems in the future, especially if it does not bring benefits.
In particular, delaying Serbia's accession to the EU could lead to Tito-inspired fantasies at the heart of the country's foreign and security policy.
Social demoralisation in the Balkans takes on a dynamic of its own when the best and brightest see their future outside their own countries and stability is just another word for political and economic stagnation.
If European leaders do plan to meet in Sarajevo in 2014, they should act now.
The ratification of the Lisbon Treaty allows for a certain visionary realism in European politics, as there are no longer any institutional obstacles to the future enlargement of the EU.
Unlike a year ago, we know how many states there are in the Balkans, and the results of the Balkan Monitor show that they all want to join the European Union.
What the EU has learned from the results of the last parliamentary elections in Bulgaria is that, contrary to popular belief, Brussels "influence over new member states increases rather than decreases after accession.
The EU's decision to relax visa requirements for Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia, and the fact that Giorgos Papandreou, the main architect of the EU's Balkan integration strategy, is back in power in Greece is another reason for optimism.
But for the Balkans, <unk> counts now or never.
The visa relaxation may be a strategic step towards shock integration, but if it is not followed by bold policy action from the EU, it could simply repackage the status quo.
Closing the European Policy Gap
MADRID The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has been a hot topic of analysis for nearly a year.
But one question has hardly been studied in depth: what does Russia's annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine say about the European Union's foreign policy?
At the beginning of the crisis, Germany, which had gambled heavily on Russian modernisation, had resisted consistent action.
But, as the crisis deepened, German Chancellor Angela Merkel tried to persuade her European counterparts to impose comprehensive and painful sanctions.
This was certainly a step in the right direction, but it did nothing to address the foreign policy mistakes that contributed to the Ukrainian crisis and continue to undermine Europe's ability to respond, mainly the EU's misguided Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and its muddled approach to energy policy.
On both of these fronts, the EU's lack of strategic vision has led to the impression that Russia's President Vladimir Putin is constantly outmaneuvering Europe.
It increasingly seems that Ukraine is caught in a frozen conflict with Russia's foreign policy specialty.
Indeed, the situation in Ukraine amounts to a tactical victory for Russia, and the fragile but enduring ceasefire and associated laws guaranteeing Donetsk and Luhansk significant political autonomy allow Russia to keep the conflict close to its border with the EU.
Furthermore, the delay in introducing important elements of the Association Agreement with Ukraine is clear proof that the conditions of EU-Ukraine relations are currently being dictated by Russia.
In Europe, the Kremlin has been able to pursue a successful divide-and-rule strategy, especially in light of Hungary's decision to cut off gas transit to Ukraine.
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's government, whose behavior in recent years contradicted the EU's democratic criteria, now openly supports authoritarian regimes, particularly Putin's, which could have serious consequences for European unity.
Nonetheless, the timing of the current ceasefire, which coincides with the creation of a new EU Commission, is beneficial, as is Putin's myopic emphasis on tactical victories.
EU leaders should use the pause to stop reacting and start looking to the future.
With a long-term strategic vision, the EU could neutralize and ultimately undermine Putin's short-term successes.
Such a vision must also include a reformulation of the ENP.
Ultimately, the problem is not the mission of the programme to help guide the political, social and economic transition of neighbouring countries, but rather the way in which it is interpreted and implemented.
Firstly, the ENP presupposes that all of the EU's neighbours, both to the south and east, ultimately want to introduce European values and structures into their own countries.
In other words, it does not take into account the development, cultural and future-oriented differences between the EU partner countries.
In its implementation, the ENP suffers from an excessively technical approach and a lack of strategic vision.
For example, before the crisis in Ukraine, the European Commission was so focused on negotiating the technical details of the association agreement that it did not consider the possible consequences, such as a Russian response.
To be sure, the EU has recognised the need for a coherent strategy and has tried to meet it by establishing the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs.
But the EEAS ended up in a rift with the European Commission, and outgoing High Representative Catherine Ashton did little to ease tensions, unwilling to interfere in EU internal disagreements.
It is striking that Ashton has made progress only in areas where there was complete consensus, such as the negotiations on Iran's nuclear programme and the pact between Kosovo and Serbia.
Furthermore, European effectiveness is being eroded by the fragmented approach to safeguarding energy stocks.
As each country largely pursues its own energy policy, the European energy market has become inefficient and overly dependent on supplies from Russia.
To the extent that there was an EU-wide energy strategy, it referred to renewable energies and not to the interplay of geopolitics and energy security.
But there is reason for hope.
The new Commission, comprehensively restructured by its President Jean Claude Juncker, could provide Europe with much-needed strategic leadership.
In fact, Juncker has already expressed his intention to include the future High Representative Federica Mogherini in the Commission's programme of measures.
The new structure, under which Mogherini is tasked with leading and coordinating the work of several commissioners, including those responsible for trade, the ENP and climate and energy, should strengthen the coherence and direction of EU policy, especially after Mogherini has completed her inquiry into the global strategic landscape commissioned by the Council of Europe.
But a restructured Commission is not enough to ensure a fresh start in Europe's foreign policy strategy.
To do so, Mogherini would have to prevail with the support of Juncker and new Council of Europe president Donald Tusk as leader.
Most importantly, all EU members must recommit to cooperation.
The Ukrainian people have demonstrated the power of European values.
In fact, Europe has many tools at its disposal, it just needs to find out how they can be used.
If this happens, the continent will be better able to respond not only to the Russian challenge, but also to many of the other problems of today's fast-changing global environment.
Failed global economic recovery
NEW HAVEN - The global economy is experiencing its second growth panic in less than two years.
Get used to it.
In a post-crisis world, this is a sign of a failed recovery.
The reason is simple.
The typical business cycle has a natural damping mechanism that absorbs unexpected shocks.
The worse the downturn, the stronger the backlash, and the greater the cumulative power of a self-sustaining revival.
Pronounced V-shaped upswings are characterized by a built-in elasticity, which allows them to remove vibrations relatively easily.
Recovery from a crisis, however, is quite another matter.
As Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have shown in their book This Time Is Different, economic performance and employment tend to recover well below average in the long run after a crisis.
Such weak recoveries are by definition lacking in cushioning V-shaped recoveries.
Accordingly, external shocks quickly reveal their vulnerability.
If such shocks are strong enough to hit a weakened global economy approaching its annual growth rate of about 3%, the setback could turn into the dreaded W-shaped recession.
That risk exists today.
The clearly below-average nature of the global economic recovery is unmistakable.
On the surface, the figures look good: global GDP rebounded by 5.1% in 2010 and is expected to increase by a further 4.3% in 2011, according to the International Monetary Fund.
But, because these gains follow the huge slowdown during the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the trajectory of a classic V-shaped recovery is nowhere near achieved.
Indeed, if the IMF's current projections prove correct, global GDP will still be about 2.2 percentage points below what it would have been at the end of 2012 if the world had maintained its longer-term annual growth rate of 3.7%.
Even if the global economy maintains its 4.3% growth rate, which I think is very questionable, it will remain below the trend line for eight years, until 2015.
This persistent global output gap underscores the lack of cushioning in today's global economy and its increased vulnerability to shocks.
And there have clearly been plenty of such blows in recent months, from Europe's debt crisis and the natural disasters in Japan to soaring oil prices and another setback in the US housing market.
While none of these shocks appears to have been severe enough to derail the global economy, their overall impact is worrisome, especially in a still-weakening post-crisis world.
Most observers rule out the possibility of a double-dip recession.
They call the current slowdown a temporary sign of weakness and link their optimism to the inevitable recovery that follows any shocks.
For example, rebuilding and restoring supply chains in Japan is expected to give a boost to economic development.
The recent move by the US to tap its strategic oil reserves to push down oil prices could also help.
But in the wake of the worst crisis and recession of our time, where shocks can tip an already weakened global economy to the tipping point much faster than would be the case under a stronger-growth scenario, the escape velocity of a self-sustaining recovery is much harder to achieve.
The weakening phase could be more of a swamp.
This conclusion should not have escaped the attention of successful emerging economies, particularly in Asia, the world's fastest-growing and currently leading region in what is now called the two-speed world.
But with exports still accounting for a record 45% of the region's GDP, Asia can ill afford to take external shocks lightly, especially when they come against an already weakened underlying growth pattern in the post-crisis developed world.
The recent slowdown in Chinese industrial activity underscores this risk.
Policymakers are ill-prepared for a steady stream of growth shocks.
It continues to favour strategies that are better suited to combating crises than to promoting a post-crisis cure.
This certainly applies to the United States.
While the first round of quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve effectively ended a painful crisis, the second round did little to sustain a significant recovery in the labor market and the real economy.
America's cash-strapped consumers need to fix their damaged balance sheets, and American workers need to match new skills with new jobs.
Endless injections of liquidity do neither.
The European authorities are caught in a similar mindset.
Europe, because it misunderstands a solvency problem as a lack of liquidity, relies on bailouts with ever more cash injections.
But they only work if countries like Greece escape the debt trap of growth or abandon their entrenched social contracts.
The chances of both are exceptionally slim.
The likelihood of repeated growth shocks over the next few years leaves little hope for new, creative approaches to post-crisis monetary and fiscal policy.
Faced with short-term electoral horizons, politicians are constantly seeking a quick fix - another bailout or injection of liquidity.
But, after a balance-sheet recession in the US and amid a debt trap in Europe, such an approach is doomed to failure.
Liquidity injections and bailouts serve only one purpose: to buy time.
But time is not the answer for economies in desperate need of structural repairs - fiscal consolidation, private-sector deleveraging, labor-market reforms, or increased competitiveness.
Nor does time cushion anemic post-crisis recoveries from the inevitable next shock.
It is difficult to say when the next shock will strike or what form it will take; otherwise it would not be a shock.
But that such disruption is unavoidable is as certain as Amen in the Church.
And, with policymakers reluctant to focus on the need for structural healing, the result will be a renewed growth panic, or worse.
The failed recovery underscores the risks of an increasingly insidious endgame in today's post-crisis world.
A fair deal for Turkey
The European Commission has given Turkey something of an ultimatum: either it opens its ports to Cyprus vessels within a month or it risks breaking off accession talks.
At the same time, the Commission's latest progress report notes that the political reform process has slowed down, further calling into question the country's future EU membership.
The European Council will discuss the Commission's progress report next month.
At this meeting, European leaders should ask themselves the following questions: has Turkey been treated fairly by the EU on the Cyprus issue?
Has the EU been consistent in its support for political reform in Turkey?
What are the EU's long-term interests towards Turkey?
If the answer to the first two questions is' no '- which is my personal view - then the third is crucial.
Admittedly, Turkey has closed its ports to ships from (the Greek part of) Cyprus, in breach of agreements.
But it is also true that the Turkish north of Cyprus is denied access to free trade and other benefits of EU membership.
That is why Cyprus remains a divided island.
It was expected that Cyprus would be united when it joined the EU in 2004.
A UN plan for reunification was accepted by the Turkish part of the island.
However, Greek Cypriots rejected the plan because their political leaders failed to support it, as implicitly agreed with the EU.
Nevertheless, Cyprus became an EU member, but only the Greek part.
That was clearly a mistake, because that is how the EU became a party to the conflict.
This gave Greek Cypriot leaders the opportunity to block progress in the EU-Turkey negotiations.
In these circumstances, how can Turkey maintain its confidence in the fairness of the EU?
The political and legal reforms in Turkey in recent years have been extraordinarily far-reaching, because they were clearly driven by the Turks "desire to move closer to the EU.
Support for EU membership plummeted among the Turkish people, however, when they felt they were not being treated fairly.
This gave new impetus to those who envisage Turkey's development in a different direction, towards a more Islamic society and away from a modern secular state.
Therefore, the recent lack of progress in Turkey's reform process can be explained in large part by the EU's behavior.
This brings us to the third question: which Turkey does the EU want?
There should be no doubt about the answer: it is clearly in the EU's interest to see democracy and the economy in Turkey continue to be strengthened.
More than 40 years ago, it was promised that Turkey would be welcomed as a member of the EU as soon as it met the admission criteria.
It is high time that European leaders took this promise seriously.
The sad fact is that the majority of EU citizens are opposed to Turkish accession.
But they are responding to the current situation.
If they were asked if they want a reformed Turkey as a partner, a Turkey that fully meets the Copenhagen criteria (democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and an effective market economy), far more people would be willing to accept Turkey as an EU member.
European governments must therefore face two challenges.
First, they should tell their voters clearly that the EU must deliver on its promises to Turkey, and that this is in the greater interest of all Europeans.
Secondly, Turkey should be offered a fair deal in the negotiations.
The first test of European leadership concerns the practical problem of access to ports.
On this issue, the Finns, who currently hold the Presidency of the Council, have proposed an initiative to implement a pragmatic solution that takes into account the positions of both parties to the conflict.
This Finnish initiative should be strongly supported by all European Heads of Government.
At the same time, efforts should be made to breathe life into the UN proposals for Cyprus.
If that means putting pressure on some players in the EU's ranks, so be it.
Fair Deal on Climate Change
The agreement reached by the G8 leaders in Heiligendamm on climate change merely sets the stage for the real debate to come: how will we share the declining capacity of the atmosphere to absorb our greenhouse gases?
G8 leaders have agreed to seek substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and give serious consideration to the goal of halving those emissions by 2050, an outcome hailed as a triumph by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
But the agreement does not oblige anyone to meet certain objectives, least of all the United States, whose President George W. Bush will be out of office in 2009, when the difficult decisions are due.
One might reasonably ask why anyone would regard such a vague agreement as a success.
At the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, 189 countries including the United States, China, India and all European nations signed the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, agreeing to stabilize greenhouse emissions at low enough levels to avoid dangerous man-made disruptions to the climate system.
Fifteen years later, no country has done so.
US greenhouse gas emissions per capita, already the highest of any major country, continued to rise when Bush took office.
In March, a leaked Bush administration report showed that US emissions are expected to increase almost as sharply over the next decade as they have over the past decade.
So now there is another agreement to do what the same nations committed to do 15 years ago.
Is this supposed to be a triumph?
If Bush or his successor wants to ensure that the next round of talks fails, they will not have a hard time.
In justifying his refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol, Bush has always invoked the fact that it does not impose binding emission limits on China and India.
Today, in response to proposals by Bush and other G8 leaders, the head of China's National Development and Reform Commission, Ma Kai, says that the major developing countries must contribute to solving climate change, that China will not commit to quantified targets for reducing emissions.
Indian Foreign Minister Navtej Sarna has also said that his country would oppose such binding restrictions.
Are China and India Behaving Irrationally?
Their leaders have consistently pointed out that our current problems are the result of gases released by developed countries over the last century.
This is true: almost all of those gases are still in the atmosphere, and without them the problem would not be nearly as pressing as it is today.
China and India claim the right to continue their countries "industrialization and development as developed countries used to, without being held back by restrictions on their greenhouse gas emissions.
China, India and other developing countries have a point, in three ways.
The first is that, on the basis of the polluter pays principle, developed countries must take responsibility for damaging our atmosphere, which cannot absorb further greenhouse emissions without changing the climate.
Second, even if we start from scratch and leave aside who caused the problem, a typical US resident causes six times as many greenhouse gas emissions as a typical Chinese and 18 times as many as an average Indian.
Third, richer countries are more likely than poorer countries to shoulder the costs of dealing with the problem without their populations suffering seriously.
It is just as true, however, that if China and India continue to increase their greenhouse-gas production, in the long run, they will undo all the industrialized countries "efforts to make significant cuts in emissions.
This year or next, China will surpass the US as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases - on a national basis, of course, not per capita.
In 25 years, said Fatih Birol, chief economist at the International Energy Agency, China's emissions could be double those of the US, Europe, and Japan combined.
However, there is a solution that would be both fair and practical:
It is hard to deny that it is fair to give every person in the world an equal share of the world's capacity to absorb greenhouse gas emissions.
Why should anyone be more entitled than anyone else to use the Earth's atmosphere?
And such a plan is not only fair, but also offers practical benefits.
It would provide a strong incentive for developing countries to accept binding quotas, because if they keep their per capita emissions low, they have emission rights that they can sell to developed nations.
Rich countries would also benefit, because they would be able to reduce their emissions in their preferred ratio and acquire emission rights from developing countries.
Farewell to the (Glorious) War
In recent days, the Italian government was overthrown after losing a parliamentary vote on the deployment of Italian troops in Afghanistan, while Britain and Denmark announced that they would begin withdrawing their troops from Iraq.
While the Bush administration is sending an additional 21,000 American troops to Iraq and pushing for more allied troops in Afghanistan, America's allies are rejecting its Middle East policy.
They are increasingly convinced that victory is elusive in any asymmetrical conflict between (however powerful) states and sectarian armed insurgents.
Donald Rumsfeld's dogma of military transformation, of technological upgrading of an army's capacity to win decisive victories with fewer troops, failed in Iraq with drumbeat and trumpets.
Israel, with its overwhelming technological advantage, could not beat Hezbollah in Lebanon either.
More missiles and missiles fell on northern Israel in 33 days than hit Britain during the entire Second World War.
So the Israelis must now brace themselves for an entirely new phenomenon: an asymmetrical entity, Hezbollah, with the firepower of a nation-state.
So the fierce debate over whether to increase the number of American ground troops in Iraq misses the point.
Neither the Soviet experience in Afghanistan in the 1980 "s nor that of NATO today justify the claim that troop numbers matter most on the modern battlefield.
When there are no geostrategic military front lines, as in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, mass is no longer synonymous with victory.
<unk>'s great military theorist Carl von Clausewitz's idea of decisive battles as <unk>'s focal point of war is simply irrelevant in conflicts with no discernible <unk> focus.
Although wars from the time Hannibal defeated the Romans in 216 BC to the Gulf War in 1991 had this focus, and thus a massive concentration of forces could bring the enemy to its knees, such wars between the developed countries have in fact become a historical anachronism.
Most states today are within borders that are widely recognized as legitimate, and they increasingly adhere to international norms of conduct in times of war.
Indeed, asymmetric wars are made particularly insoluble by the obligation of states to abide by humanitarian codes of conduct, while their enemies make warfare as barbaric as they want.
Moreover, in an age of global media and international war crimes tribunals, the criteria for states to use military means have become more complex than ever.
Intergovernmental fighting can still occur where strategic front lines are located, such as Israel's border with Syria, India's border with Pakistan, and the border that separates the two Koreas.
In such cases, as the Egyptians demonstrated in 1973, war could still serve as a solution to a conflict.
Syrians may be tempted to launch an offensive against Israel to break the stalemate over the future of the Golan Heights.
However, in the case of Kashmir, the asymmetrical conflict currently being fought by proxies and terrorist groups could not degenerate into total war precisely because India and Pakistan both have nuclear deterrence. Recently, it has even become common for states with such asymmetrical proxy conflicts to avoid paying the price for a general war.
This changing nature of the battlefield basically means that war is outdated as a decisive event in international conflicts.
The simple Clausewitz wisdom that military action ultimately leads to a political solution is no longer convincing.
A victory cannot bring peace simply because there is always war after war.
For example, the conventional war in Kosovo lasted two months, leading directly into a six-year asymmetrical conflict.
Similarly, America's three-week shock-and-awe campaign in Iraq in 2003 ended with a victory, but opened the gates to hell for occupiers as well as ordinary Iraqis.
Six months after the relentless shelling of southern Lebanon, Hezbollah is as strong as ever.
Nor does the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan, six years after their fall, seem too far-fetched for now.
Only in the war after the war does the inferiority of the occupying forces become apparent, whereby constantly new reinforcements increase the number of targets for the insurgents considerably faster than the occupying forces can adjust to the changed battlefield.
As the British admit, in just three years the insurgents in Iraq have coped with the technical superiority of their enemies in a way that the IRA in Northern Ireland has not in 30 years.
The Iraq War and Israel's wars against Hamas and Hezbollah show the limits of what military power can achieve, and also justify diplomacy and conflict resolution.
In seeking solutions to complex political and cultural conflicts, building international and regional alliances for legitimate goals is more important than mere military capacity.
On the other hand, it would be dangerously naive to believe that the exercise of power and the ability to intimidate others are unnecessary.
But the goals of the use of force must be coupled with the recognition that victories in today's asymmetrical conflicts are no longer achieved on the battlefield.
Only a better-informed foreign policy that addresses the sincere fears of civilizations in crisis will bring more lasting results.
Farewell to nuclear weapons
MOSCOW Twenty-five years ago this October, I sat opposite Ronald Reagan in Reykjavik to negotiate an agreement that should have regulated the reduction and eventual elimination of the frightening US and Soviet nuclear arsenals by 2000.
Despite our differences, Reagan and I shared the conviction that civilized countries should not make these barbaric weapons the fulcrum of their security.
Although we failed to achieve our ambitions in Reykjavik, the summit was, as my then counterpart put it, an important turning point in the quest for a safer world.
In the coming years, it may be decided whether our shared dream of ridding the world of nuclear weapons will ever become a reality.
Critics portray nuclear disarmament as at best unrealistic and at worst a dangerous utopian dream.
They point to the long Cold War peace as proof that nuclear deterrence is the only way to avert a major war.
As a former commander of these weapons, I vehemently disagree with this account.
Nuclear deterrence has always been a draconian and unstable guarantor of peace.
By failing to present a convincing plan for nuclear disarmament, the US, Russia, and the other nuclear powers are fostering a future in which nuclear weapons will inevitably be used.
This disaster must be prevented.
As I pointed out with George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger, Sam Nunn, and others five years ago, nuclear deterrence is becoming increasingly unreliable and dangerous with the growing number of nuclear-armed states.
Except in the case of preventive war (which is counterproductive) or effective sanctions (which have so far proved insufficient), only serious steps toward nuclear disarmament can provide the mutual security needed to achieve viable compromises on arms control and non-proliferation.
Trust and understanding built up in Reykjavik paved the way for two historic treaties.
In 1987, the INF Treaty destroyed the dreaded, fast-moving medium-range missiles that threatened peace in Europe at the time.
And the signing of the START I treaty in 1991 led to an 80% reduction in the US and Soviet Union's overcrowded nuclear arsenals over the next decade.
In the absence of a credible impetus for nuclear disarmament, however, prospects for progress on arms control and non-proliferation are bleak.
During the two long days in Reykjavik, I saw that disarmament talks could be as constructive as they were laborious.
By linking a series of coherent issues, Reagan and I built the trust and understanding needed to halt the nuclear arms race over which we had lost control.
In retrospect, the end of the Cold War ushered in a less orderly regime of global power and influence.
The nuclear powers should abide by the provisions of the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty and resume disarmament negotiations in good faith.
This would add to the diplomatic and moral capital of diplomats seeking to stem proliferation in a world where more countries than ever have the means to build a nuclear bomb.
Only a serious program of universal nuclear disarmament can provide the reassurance and credibility needed to build a global consensus that nuclear deterrence is a dead doctrine.
We can no longer afford the discriminatory system that divides countries into nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states, either politically or financially.
Reykjavik was proof that daring pays off.
The conditions for a disarmament agreement were far from favourable in 1986.
Before I became President of the Soviet Union in 1985, relations between the Cold War superpowers were at an all-time low.
Nevertheless, through permanent contacts and personal interaction, Reagan and I were able to create a constructive climate.
Today, there seems to be a lack of leaders with the audacity and vision to build enough confidence to reintroduce nuclear disarmament as the centerpiece of a peaceful world order.
Economic constraints and the Chernobyl disaster helped us to take the initiative.
But why have the Great Recession and the devastating meltdown at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant not elicited similar reactions today?
A first step would be for the US to finally ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty (CTBT).
President Barack Obama supports this treaty as a critical tool for preventing proliferation and nuclear war.
It is time for Obama to deliver on the commitments he made in Prague in 2009, follow in Reagan's footsteps as a great communicator, and get the US Senate to formalize America's adherence to the CTBT.
That would force the remaining holdouts -- China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, North Korea and Pakistan -- to reconsider the CTBT as well.
This would take us one step closer to a global ban on nuclear testing, whether in the air, underwater, in space or underground.
A second necessary step is for the US and Russia to take further steps toward a new START agreement, and to make even deeper cuts, especially in tactical weapons and reserve weapons, which serve no purpose, gobble up large amounts of money, and threaten security.
This step must also include restricting missile defence, which proved to be a major obstacle at the Reykjavik Summit.
A long-stalled agreement on a ban on fissile material production (FMCT) at the multilateral negotiations in Geneva and a successful second nuclear safety summit next year in Seoul will also contribute to safety in the field of hazardous nuclear materials.
This will also require renewing and expanding the Global Partnership for the Elimination of All Weapons of Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Weapons of Mass Destruction, launched in 2002, when it next meets in the US next year.
Our world is over-militarized.
In the current economic climate, nuclear weapons are becoming ghastly money-making machines.
If economic difficulties continue as expected, the US, Russia, and other nuclear powers should seize the opportunity to launch multilateral disarmament initiatives through new or existing channels, such as the UN Disarmament Conference.
These negotiations would lead to greater security for less money.
But the build-up of conventional forces, driven in large part by the enormous global military might of the US, also needs to be tackled.
As we move forward with the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), we should also seriously consider reducing the burden of military expenditure and armed forces at global level.
US President John F Kennedy once warned: "Every man, woman and child lives under a nuclear sword of Damocles, hanging by a thread of silk that can be cut at any time." For more than 50 years, mankind has viewed this lethal sword with suspicion, while world leaders debated how to repair the fraying threads.
The example of Reykjavik should remind us that mitigating measures are not enough.
Our efforts 25 years ago can only bear fruit if the atomic bomb ends up in the museum of discarded cruelty, alongside the chains of slave traders and the mustard gas of the First World War.
On the determination of Israel's hawks
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's announcement that he plans to dismantle Jewish settlements in Gaza and parts of the West Bank has surprised and shocked people in Israel and around the world.
Many have disparagingly called Sharon's plan a stunt.
Their surprise, however, is entirely unfounded.
Despite the manner in which it is often presented to outside observers, the debate in Israel about the future of the occupied territories has never been reduced to the antagonism between hawks and doves.
Like everything in Israel, this process is more complicated, especially with regard to the hawks.
There are essentially two types of Israeli hawks: let us call one ideological hawk and the other strategic hawk.
The ideological hawks see the occupied territories as an integral part of historic Israel, the homeland of the Jewish people.
For them, the territories are part of the historical heritage of the Jews, which is why they insist on calling the West Bank by its historical Hebrew name - Judea and Samaria.
Not all ideological hawks are religious; though those who are are are based on divine promises and prophecies.
But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists, and their language is similar to that of typical Central and Eastern European nationalists.
Former prime ministers Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir fall into this category.
The ideological hawks usually come from the national religious party, as well as some from the Likud party.
They are inspired by the nationalist ideology associated with Vladimir Jabotinsky, who founded "revisionist Zionism" as an opposition to the more moderate founding fathers of the state of Israel, such as Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion.
Then there are the strategic hawks.
For them, control of the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative; it is determined by security considerations, given Israel's narrow and vulnerable geographical form and the continuing hostility of the Arabs.
For them, the Jewish settlements in the occupied territories do not constitute a return to a historic homeland, but are security outposts designed to prevent attacks on Israel's interior or to repel them from a superior strategic position.
This assessment may be right or wrong, but it is not based on ideology.
Ariel Sharon, with his military background - he grew up in a social milieu much closer to the Workers "Party than to Jabotinsky's ideas - is a strategic hawk.
For ideological hawks, compromise is treason: how can one jeopardize the Jewish people's historical heritage, let alone God's promise to Abraham?
But strategic hawks are open to practical bargains and compromises - provided the right circumstances and security considerations justify them.
Sharon's steps must be seen in this context.
Sharon was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security.
He didn't bring either.
After the defeat and fall of Saddam Hussein, the danger of an "eastern front" against Israel has diminished.
In the absence of a Palestinian partner, and in the face of continuing Palestinian terrorism - which Israel's harsh counterstrikes are failing to quell - what Sharon seems to be doing now is a consequence of his strategic thinking: building an effective protective wall, relocating some of the isolated and strategically untenable settlements, and waiting for better days.
Following Sharon's statements last year, a clear pattern emerges.
First, he admitted that "a Palestinian state would eventually emerge" - a statement unthinkable to die-hard ideological hawks.
A few months later, he shocked the party conference of Likud - his own party - by declaring that the occupation was wrong and untenable - another shock for those who always talk of liberated "rather than occupied" territories.
Last December, he explicitly declared that Israel would withdraw unilaterally and that this would result in the "resettlement" of some settlements.
Though these were still mere words, it was a new language for a Likud prime minister.
Sharon's latest statements, however, explicitly designate the settlements that should be evacuated, and the director of the National Security Council, General Giora Eiland, was appointed to head an inter-ministerial resettlement committee, charged with drawing up plans for carrying out the evacuations, including compensation for the resettled settlers.
All of this has radically changed Israel's domestic political map.
Some ideological hawks in Sharon's government have threatened to resign;
Shimon Peres has stated that the Workers "Party would provide Sharon with a parliamentary safety net; there are even rumours that the Workers" Party would enter a government of national unity.
The test of example, however, lies not in the planning, but in the implementation of the trigger, and the road to it is long and bumpy.
The timing of Sharon's actions may be due to his problems with the police investigation into alleged corruption.
But anyone who wants to predict Sharon's future behavior should remember that, unlike Begin and Shamir, Sharon comes from the military, and that security, not ideology, is his primary concern.
His apparent pragmatism should therefore come as no surprise.
A foreign policy for new and old Europe
The news from Iraq reminds me of my time as Polish Prime Minister during the first Gulf War.
I watched from home on CNN as the first rockets hit Baghdad.
Hours later, the military told me that an armed conflict was looming in Iraq. "" Yes, I know, "" I replied. "" I've seen the bombing on television. ""
Twelve years later, the Polish Prime Minister no longer needs a belated phone call from his military to learn that the war in Iraq has broken out.
Within the framework of the NATO partnership, all the details of the attack were provided in advance.
Poland even takes a leading position in the occupation of Iraq.
What a long way Poland has come since the collapse of communism in 1989!
The least of all, however, is the result of a thoughtful strategy, because (unfortunately) we in Poland have failed to set long-term guidelines for our foreign policy as a NATO member and a future member of the EU.
We continue to limit ourselves to assessing the immediate benefits or harms of an initiative.
Add to that the prevailing foreign-policy schizophrenia - some Poles believe our country's very existence will influence the fate of Europe, others suffer from crippling pessimism and fear that Poland will never get beyond its status as a "second-class" country - and you have a recipe for inaction.
Somehow, we hope, things will turn for the better.
The same seems to apply to a large number of other European countries: we say we need a common foreign and security policy, but we are incapable of acting until a crisis emerges.
Then we get into an argument about what is best to do.
But we can no longer afford such a passive attitude.
For Poland, as well as for other Eastern and Central European countries that have already joined NATO, or are about to join it, a debate on alliance membership was not really necessary.
Our experience of oppression by all-powerful neighbours has taught us that collective security within NATO is the only real alternative.
EU membership and the global war on terrorism, however, require a deeper reflection.
Why so?
Because EU membership will leave no aspect of the state, economic and social system untouched, while the war on terror calls for an entirely new diplomacy and security policy.
The current crisis in transatlantic relations, and our fortuitous role in it as part of the "new Europe," according to Donald Rumsfeld, means that Poland (like any other European state) must now decide what it really expects from the EU and NATO.
We need to find an attitude to global problems that were not once at the heart of European interests, and find out what it really means to be an EU partner.
Only by finding answers to these questions can the divide between the new 'and the old' Europe, and between the new and the old Atlantic world, be bridged.
Poland, as an ally of the US, is not the real problem of President Jacques Chirac or Chancellor Gerhard Schröder.
Both are actually responding to the growing unpredictability of today's emerging European order.
They see the emergence of new players (Spain, for example) who are shaping EU policy, especially foreign policy, and notice that their traditional leadership role is being called into question.
But an EU of 10 new members simply cannot be run along the lines of past decades.
So the challenge for France and Germany is not that Poland is some sort of 'Trojan horse' of the United States.
It lies in the fact that the structure of the EU now calls not only for a new consensus on Europe's role in the world, but also for new ways of achieving that consensus.
The world needs a united, effective continent.
This consensus must include the US.
During the Cold War, most Europeans tolerated the American tendency to go it alone in the face of the Soviet threat and the sole power of the US.
But America now finds it difficult to understand the new circumstances of the post-Cold War era.
These difficulties are compounded by the fact that armed forces on both sides of the Atlantic are so different in strength, and that America is convinced that Europe's military ambitions will come to nothing because Europeans will not provide the necessary resources.
Here Poland can help to redress the Atlantic rift and build a European consensus.
September 1939 made it clear to every Polish that armed forces must be powerful in order to make a difference.
With good intentions alone, no intruder can be repelled.
As the Danish Prime Minister said recently: "France and Germany are not in a position to guarantee the security of our country.
The United States is, but security is not for nothing. "'
Most Poles see the situation in Poland in a similar way.
In fact, the whole of Europe is dependent on America.
But this dependence should not obscure the fact that Europe and America share common foreign-policy interests.
If the EU builds its foreign and security policy on this fact, many of today's differences will dissipate.
EU foreign policy should be guided by the following objectives:
The fight against terror,
The prevention of local conflicts,
The promotion of human rights and democracy,
To hold unpredictable countries to account,
Maintaining close relations between Europe and the United States,
Assistance to poor countries.
Poland's foreign policy, like that of the EU, can only be effective in the long term if it takes realistic steps - and if the necessary resources are made available - to achieve these objectives.
They are the only possible basis for transatlantic relations, in an enlarged Union and in the relationship between the new '' and 'old' 'Europe.
of Bjørn Lomborg
PRAGUE - Global weather conditions this summer have fed the debate about global warming.
Droughts and heatwaves are the harbingers of our future, the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is more necessary than ever, but meaningful measures have not yet been implemented.
Away from this well-known conflict zone, however, an astonishing thing has happened: carbon dioxide emissions in the United States have fallen to the lowest level in the last 20 years.
Data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) for the first five months of 2012 show that expected CO2 emissions have fallen by more than 800 million tonnes, or 14 percent, from their 2007 peak.
This is due to an unprecedented switch to natural gas, which emits 45 percent less CO2 per unit of energy.
In the US, about half of electricity was typically generated from coal and about 20% from gas.
Over the past five years, these values have changed, initially slowly and now dramatically: in April this year, coal's share of electricity generation fell to just 32%, the same level as gas.
America's rapid switch to natural gas is the result of three decades of innovation, most notably the development of so-called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which has unlocked vast new resources of formerly unexploitable shale gas.
Despite some legitimate security concerns, the enormous benefits of this method cannot be overstated.
For starters, fracking has dramatically reduced the price of gas.
Adjusted for inflation, gas is not as cheap as it has been in the past 35 years, with prices this year 3-5 times lower than in the mid-2000s.
And while an economic slowdown may explain a small part of the decline in US carbon dioxide emissions, the EIA stresses that the main reason is increased use of natural gas.
This reduction in emissions is all the more impressive given that the US has added 57 million additional energy consumers over the past two decades.
Indeed, per capita carbon emissions in the US have fallen by about 20% and are now at their lowest level since Dwight D. Eisenhower left the White House in 1961.
David Victor, an energy expert at the University of California, San Diego, estimates that the switch from coal to natural gas has reduced US CO2 emissions by 400-500 megatons (MT) per year.
This is twice the overall effect of the Kyoto Protocol on CO2 emissions from the rest of the world, including the European Union.
It is tempting to believe that renewable energy sources are responsible for the reductions in emissions, but the figures tell a very different story.
By reducing CO2 emissions by 50 MT per year, America's 30,000 wind turbines contribute only one-tenth of the value of natural gas.
Biofuels reduce emissions by only ten MT and solar panels by a paltry three MT.
This contradicts the conventional wisdom that mandatory carbon reductions through emissions trading with quantitative limits or a carbon tax are the only way to tackle climate change.
But, based on experience in Europe, these measures are precisely the wrong way to address the problem of global warming.
Since 1990, the EU has subsidised solar and wind energy by more than 15 billion euros a year.
Nonetheless, per capita CO2 emissions have fallen by less than half the level achieved in the US, and in percentage terms the US is now doing better.
Nor has the EU witnessed a gas miracle, owing to widespread scepticism about fracking in Europe, while the abundance of heavily subsidized renewable energy sources has been the cause of overachieving the CO2 target.
Ironically, this, combined with the closure of German nuclear power stations, has led to a comeback of coal.
Well-meaning US policymakers have also demonstrated how not to address the problem of global warming with subsidies and tax breaks.
The relatively small reduction in emissions from wind power costs more than €2.5 billion per year, and the much smaller emission reductions from ethanol (biofuels) and solar panels amount to at least €6.5 billion and €2.3 billion per year.
Estimates show that carbon taxes would cost €193 billion a year in the EU for a further reduction of 330 MT of CO2.
Meanwhile, in the US, fracking not only brings far greater emission reductions at no cost, but also creates long-term social benefits through lower energy costs.
The astonishing truth is that fracking succeeds where Kyoto and carbon taxes fail.
According to a study by the Breakthrough Institute, fracking was developed through substantial government investment in technological innovation over three decades.
Climate economists have repeatedly pointed out that such energy innovation is the most effective climate solution, because it is the surest way to lower the price of future green energy sources below that of fossil fuels.
By contrast, the current subsidy of ineffective solar energy or ethanol is primarily a waste of money that benefits vested interests.
America gets something for nothing
BERKELEY At this year's International Monetary Fund meeting, former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers offered a stark comparison: governments, Summers said, are trying to treat a broken ankle when the patient is facing organ failure.
Summers criticized Europe for focusing all its attention on the secondary issue of Greece, even though far more serious imbalances are worsening by the day - between the north and south of the EU, and between reckless bank creditors and governments that failed to bring about proper regulation.
But Americans on the other side of the Atlantic have no reason for complacency.
Summers could have applied his metaphor to the United States, where the ongoing debate over long-term funding gaps in Social Security is killing off all efforts to address America's macroeconomic crisis and unemployment.
The US government can now borrow for 30 years at a real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate of 1% per year.
Suppose the US government borrows an additional $500 billion over the next two years and spends that money on infrastructure, even on unproductive projects with a paltry 25% annual social return.
Suppose, as seems to be the case, that the simple Keynesian multiplier for public spending is only two, in which case the additional $500 billion for infrastructure would produce an additional $1 trillion in goods and services over the next two years.
Moreover, it would generate about seven million person-years of additional employment and reduce the unemployment rate by two percentage points in each of the two years.
And, given the greater labor-force connectivity among people who have jobs, unemployment would likely be about 0.1 percentage points lower indefinitely thereafter.
However, this is not the end of the impressive gains.
Improved infrastructure would provide an additional $20 billion in income and benefits.
A lower future unemployment rate would bring another $20 billion a year in increased output.
And half of the additional $1 trillion in goods and services would be available to American households as consumer goods and services.
Overall, the benefits of the measure can be measured as follows: more jobs today, an additional $500 billion for consumption of goods and services over the next two years, and an annual cash flow of $40 billion later, owing to higher incomes and production.
So what is the likely cost of the $500 billion that could go into infrastructure over the next two years?
For starters, the $500 billion in additional government spending would be partially offset by $300 billion in higher tax revenues from stronger economic activity.
The net result would be a $200 billion increase in the national debt.
American taxpayers would have to pay $2 billion in real interest on this additional debt over the next 30 years, and then pay off the debt or roll over the entire $200 billion.
But the annual $40 billion in higher economic activity would bring in about $10 billion in additional annual tax revenue.
If some of it were used to repay real interest and save the rest, the tax-financed reserves generated by the healthier economy would be higher at maturity than the amount needed to pay off the additional debt.
In other words, taxpayers benefit, because the benefits of the improved economy outweigh the cost of paying off the higher national debt, allowing the government to provide more services without raising taxes.
Households also benefit, because they get to buy more and nicer things for their income.
Firms benefit because goods and labor can benefit from improved infrastructure.
The unemployed benefit because some of them get jobs.
And even bondholders benefit, because they get their money back at the agreed interest rates.
So what's not to like about it?
Nothing.
You might now ask how I come to say this.
As an economist and professor of economics, I know that there is nothing to give away, where benefits are always outweighed by costs, and where stories that are too good to be true are almost invariably true.
However, two things are different today.
First, the US labor market is failing to such an extent that increased government spending has no resource cost to society as a whole.
Second, bond investors are really stupid.
In a world where the S & P 500 has an annual return of 7%, no one should be happy to own a 30-year, inflation-adjusted US government bond that yields 1% per year.
This difference in expected real returns is a measure of bond investors "extraordinary and irrational panic.
They are prepared to pay 6 per cent a year for security.
For now, however, the US government can provide certainty by printing bonds.
The French cure against the resource curse
NEW YORK The campaign for mandatory disclosure of the financial dealings of mining companies to their host countries is gaining momentum, with France leading the effort.
President Nicolas Sarkozy deserves applause for supporting a new initiative to promote strict transparency standards for oil, gas and mining companies listed on European stock exchanges.
France, a country at the heart of the European Union and this year also the chair of both the G-8 and the G-20, is in the exceptional position of initiating such a regulatory step.
2011 offers a unique opportunity for the major capital markets, led by France, to establish clear and precise rules for full financial disclosure of raw materials companies to government authorities.
Exploring oil and gas and mining generates billions of dollars for governments and businesses each year.
Moreover, these industries often play a central role in the economic development of resource-rich countries.
Yet, despite the great wealth of resources, the majority of people in these countries live in poverty.
The actual level of taxes and other payments that oil, gas, and mining companies make to states is usually a closely guarded secret, though most of these governments claim to use the revenue for the common good.
The reality is that ordinary citizens in too many countries do not have any of this money; rather, they bear the brunt of the environmental and social costs of mining and other drilling activities.
In fact, these well-kept industrial and government secrets can have serious and far-reaching implications.
Consider the uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East.
In these countries, many of which have rich oil and gas resources, citizens are protesting against corruption and political repression.
At bottom, people are protesting against the mismanagement of natural resources that prevails in their countries, with consequences for the security and affordability of the world's energy supply.
Transparency is a key part of problem solving.
Citizens everywhere must be assured that oil and gas companies, as well as mining companies, must disclose all relevant financial information, sorted by country and project, including all payments into the public budgets of the host countries.
If European regulators can agree on these requirements for all commodity companies listed on their exchanges, this transparency provision will apply to all companies, regardless of where their headquarters are located.
Regulators must also stipulate that annual reports must be submitted regularly and on time, easily accessible, and comparable across countries and companies.
In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 already passed a law requiring disclosure of payments to governments.
The provision requiring companies to fully disclose their revenues by country and project applies to 90% of international oil and gas companies and to eight out of ten of the largest mining companies.
This will help citizens understand what is happening with the money, but it will not help them to judge whether their governments are getting their fair share.
If the EU required firms to publish detailed information on production and operating figures, balance sheets and payments to public authorities, companies would be truly accountable to citizens and government revenues would increase.
Such regulatory reform is now being considered by the European Commission, and French support is essential if the EU is to announce this month the necessary legislative steps to promote transparency.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde recently stressed the need to support industry initiatives aimed at increasing control, integrity and transparency in economic transactions.
At the just concluded Deauville Summit, the G8 called for mandatory reports for oil, gas and mining companies for the first time, which is a significant step forward, but unfortunately limited by the possibility of voluntary approaches and also focuses only on transparency in payments.
The world must now turn its attention to the G-20 summit in Cannes next November to make the necessary unequivocal commitments on disclosure rules.
Particularly because important emerging economies such as Brazil, India, China, South Africa, and other resource-rich African countries will be around the table.
French Presidency Primer
Former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson used to joke that a week in politics is a long time.
Thus, any prediction made in the roughly 30 weeks leading up to the French presidential election could be reversed several times before the election.
But two candidates have emerged as clear and consistent favorites in opinion polls: Nicolas Sarkozy on the right and Ségolène Royale on the left.
In fact, they have more in common than one might think at first sight, for both speak of a break with the past, although they embody a certain consistency.
For Sarkozy, the split reflects both sober tactical and highly personal choices.
Jacques Chirac's 12-year presidency and France's tradition of alternating parties in power point to a victory for the left.
His only way to escape this fate is to position himself as the candidate who represents a sharp break with current unpopular policies.
This is reflected in Sarkozy's openly pro-Americanism stance, which demonstrates political courage in France, where anti-Americanism is high on the agenda.
Sarkozy's message is that Chirac and Villepin were right to oppose America's military adventure in Iraq, but they were disastrously wrong about style.
So while his sincere admiration for American values does not mean he would welcome President George W. Bush's stance.
This also reassures the French business community, which was shocked by Dominique de Villepin's fierce opposition to the United States when he was foreign minister under Chirac.
In his homeland, Sarkozy addressed his message especially to young people and launched a patriotic appeal to the values of work and discipline, a counter-revolutionary revolution.
The revolution that must be overcome is the one of May 1968, whose leaders and supporters, according to Sarkozy, were politically inferior to de Gaulle but greatly weakened France in subsequent decades by their emphasis on false values.
Instead, rebellion against the parent generation and the rediscovery of traditional moral views will save France, a message that can be applied extremely well to issues like education and immigration, which may dominate the campaign.
In the case of Royal, the significance of <unk>'s break is both clear and obvious.
She is trying to become the first woman president of the French Republic.
To achieve her goal, she prefers to emphasise her <unk> essence as the antidote to Sarkozy's emphasis on his reputation as a <unk> doer.
She addresses voters in a simple way: "I'm a woman, and you've never tried it with a woman at the helm, so be modern and vote for one now."
Royal, who hides behind the novelty (relative to the French presidency) of her gender, has avoided elaborating.
She has (so far!) fended off questions from curious journalists wanting to know more about her political programme by saying: "You wouldn't dare ask me such a question if I wasn't a woman!"
So Royal's programme is her popularity.
In foreign policy, one can only guess where their priorities would lie.
As for Europe, she seems as agnostic as Sarkozy, who like her embodies a new generation of post-European politicians.
In terms of values, Royal's emphasis on discipline and family also seems to represent a break with May 1968.
Opinion polls show Royal as the clear favourite of the left and the only candidate capable of defeating Sarkozy.
She has strong support among women voters in particular.
For the Socialist Party, which is eager to return to power but has not yet recovered from the humiliating defeat of Lionel Jospin in the first round of the 2002 presidential election, the question is whether it can afford to resist the wave of positive public opinion that is driving Royal?
For the many opponents of King among leading politicians and socialist fighters, media dominance in the political process leads to mediocrity: the qualities needed to be elected are almost incompatible with those needed to govern.
According to Royal's critics in the Socialist ranks, the Hollywoodisation of the politics from which it benefits brings a new approach, with politicians following suit and supporters leading.
But the same criticism can be directed at Sarkozy.
Moreover, both candidates embody continuity as much as the break with the past, with Chirac and Gaullism backing Sarkozy and François Mitterrand's socialism backing Royal.
In her quest for legitimacy, Royal openly claims Mitterrand's legacy, while Sarkozy's rejection of Chirac's legacy has more to do with form than substance.
To a large extent, Sarkozy can be seen as Chirac with more, while Royal is clearly Mitterrand with less.
If voters decide in the spring of 2007, their choice is likely to depend more on negative than positive considerations, just as Chirac did in 2002, when he ran against the hated nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen in the second round.
As in 2002, whoever voters detest or fear less will win next year.
Either way, personalities will be more important than programs.
A New Beginning for China and Japan?
Edmonton: Chinese President Hu Jintao will travel to Japan from May 6-10 for a high-profile visit.
He is the second Chinese head of state to visit the country, a trip that has been carefully planned by both countries and is being closely watched around the world, and with good reason: Sino-Japanese relations have been tumultuous over the past decade, to say the least.
When Hu's predecessor, Jiang Zemin, visited Japan a decade ago, bilateral relations were about to deteriorate: China was unhappy at the Japanese government's refusal to extend to China the apology made to South Korea for past aggression;
Concerned by China's rise in power, Japan became increasingly confrontational.
Japanese media coverage of the visit was almost entirely negative, and it was remembered as a PR disaster.
Hu became Jiang's successor in 2002, almost at the same time that former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi came to power in Japan, touting a "new thinking" in China's Japan policy aimed at moving away from historical grievances and improving relations.
But rather than accept China's offer of peace, Koizumi pursued a more nationalist agenda, including annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, seen by Japan's neighbors as a symbol of Japanese militarism.
His hardline stance isolated Japan and angered China, leading to an outbreak of anti-Japanese demonstrations in 2005.
But both Japan and China recognize that further tensions are hurting both countries "long-term interests.
Koizumi's successors, Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda, have sought to deepen ties with China over the past two years, with summits in Beijing and a successful visit to Japan last year by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.
Hu's visit is likely to follow Wen's lead.
It will emphasise common strategic interests, highlight mutual economic benefits, encourage positive public opinion and encourage further contacts.
Japan is not only one of China's most important trade and investment partners, but also its most powerful neighbor, with which China wants to maintain good relations, to prove that China's rise does not pose a threat to Asia and the rest of the world.
Japan, whose economic recovery relies largely on deepening relations with China in recent years, is also eager to show that it sees China not as a danger, but as an opportunity, at least economically.
It is 30 years since then-Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, the current Prime Minister's father, signed a peace and friendship treaty with China.
The two governments will certainly use Hu's visit to mark the anniversary with new programs aimed at deepening mutual understanding and friendship.
But, unlike 30 years ago, when the Japanese viewed China as a particularly close country, public opinion in both countries today is driven by negative rather than positive feelings.
Behind the smiles, polite dialogue and carefully worded statements of diplomats, there is still a great deal of suspicion and distrust.
One problem is the disputed waters in the East China Sea.
Despite new joint projects to increase energy efficiency and protect the environment, where China considers Japan to be the best-performing of the developed world, the two sides remain bitterly divided over these territorial waters, with their potentially vast oil, gas and other mineral resources.
Despite many talks, no solution is in sight, and no breakthrough is expected from Hu's visit.
Then there is mistrust on strategic issues.
Fukuda has dropped Abe's formulation of an arc of freedom, an attempt to forge a common bloc with the US, Australia and India.
But Japan remains concerned about the rapid modernization of China's military, while China is concerned about a potential US-Japan containment strategy for China, especially in the event of a crisis in the Taiwan Strait.
So while both sides support the idea of a mutually beneficial strategic relationship, and despite progress in bilateral military contacts, there is still a long way to go toward mutual trust.
Moreover, today's trend toward warm politics and cool economics embodies the opposite of the pattern of cool politics and warm economics under Koizumi.
Last year, the number of fixed investment projects in China fell by 24% compared with 2006, and actual investment volumes fell by 25%, partly due to new foreign investment regulatory rules in China.
Recent food safety issues, such as the case of poisoned pork meatballs, have clearly increased Japanese public sensitivity to Chinese exports.
Finally, there is still the possibility that historical disputes will come to the fore and create new problems.
While Fukuda has made it clear he will not visit the Yasukuni shrine, 160 other lawmakers have paid tribute to Yasukuni in the past month, a sign that conservative forces in Japan remain strong and that future prime ministers may not refrain from visiting the shrine.
Moreover, Japan has so far failed to fulfill its treaty obligations to eliminate the 700,000 to 2 million chemical weapons left in China by the Japanese army at the end of World War II - another potential trigger for conflict if those weapons lead to death or injury in China.
A fresh start for Europe in Latin America?
MILAN - Brazil and Mexico will be among the world's top six economies by 2050, according to analysts at investment bank Goldman Sachs.
Does the European Union care?
Should Latin America become Europe's next missed business opportunity?
Latin America has a population of 550 million people with an annual per capita income of $4000, immense natural resources, and considerable human capital.
Latin America accounts for 8% of world output, and the economy has grown at an annual rate of more than 5% over the last three years.
Although the United States remains the main buyer of Latin American and Caribbean exports, Asia is becoming an increasingly important market for mineral-derived goods.
Over the past four years, Latin America has attracted an average of $61 billion a year in foreign direct investment, 60% of which has gone to Brazil and Mexico.
In the 1990s, foreign investors were attracted mainly by privatisation programmes in the region, but recently mergers and acquisitions and projects in undeveloped rural areas have been the most common type of investment.
Predictably, Spain is the biggest European investor in the region, although several major Spanish companies have recently been taken over by Italian companies, including utility Endesa, which was bought by Enel, now Latin America's largest private electricity supplier.
Meanwhile, Latin American companies have increased their own foreign investment.
In 2006, Brazil invested $28.2 billion abroad, compared with an inflow of $18.8 billion.
Indeed, emerging business giants from Latin America and Asia will be at the center of global investment in the coming decades.
In 2006, the Italian Fiat Group and the Indian company Tata Motors set up a joint venture to manufacture passenger cars and engines in India.
The following year, they expanded their partnership to Latin America, investing $80 million in the production of a Tata pickup truck at the Fiat factory in Cordoba, Argentina.
One can only hope that many more large European firms will follow suit.
But it is difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which make up the majority of firms in Latin America and Europe, to trade and invest internationally, in part because of high transaction and information costs.
In Europe, groups of SMEs seem to benefit from mass production and diversification and thus succeed together in the global market.
In Latin America, this European experience is now extensively examined.
Following the model of the Italian industrial districts, four local production systems in Brazil have joined forces for the Promos / Sebrae / BID project.
Between 2002 and 2006, the Brazilian authorities responsible for supporting SMEs, together with the Milan Chamber of Commerce, established partnerships in various sectors, including furniture, footwear, designer underwear and handicrafts from various regions of the country.
It is quite possible that this approach already hints at future developments.
But the EU's association agreement with Mexico is 10 years old, and Europe does not yet have a strategic partnership with Brazil.
This is partly because of the never-ending negotiations with Mercosur, the much-troubled and still incomplete Latin American customs union.
The EU is currently negotiating various trade liberalisation agreements with all Latin American regional blocs: Mercosur, the Caribbean Community, the Central American Common Market (MCCA) and the Andean Community.
The EU must press its Latin American partners for further integration.
The implementation of a common rule of origin for their products would be an incentive to further liberalise their international trade, thereby allowing it to grow.
Full trade liberalisation in Latin America is a difficult objective, but it must be placed at the heart of the EU's strategy, as it would rapidly increase economic growth.
But even if tariffs and quotas are gradually reduced, trade flows could remain low if other trade costs remain high.
EU cooperation should therefore be geared towards reducing trade costs.
The key issue is access to the market.
Most Latin American countries are still achieving meagre results in their export efforts to Europe, with the exception of raw materials and energy resources.
Following the establishment of the EU-Chile Free Trade Area, Chilean exports to the EU have increased considerably.
But in the case of trade liberalization between the EU and Mexico, imports from the EU have grown faster than exports to Europe, resulting in a growing Mexican trade deficit with the EU.
This does not fit in with what the EU has been saying since the Rio Summit in 1999, namely that Latin America is an important political and economic partner.
Europe must change its approach if a strategic partnership is to emerge.
The European Commission has understood this.
Although the EU does not have a strategic partnership with Brazil, it intends to establish one as soon as possible.
In mid-2007, the Commission confirmed that it would resume the EU's dialogue with Mercosur with the aim of giving fresh impetus to the negotiations.
But it is clear that the EU's hopes for a special relationship with Brazil must not hamper regional integration or exacerbate asymmetries and imbalances within the bloc.
If Latin America is to become a strategic partner of the EU and a more attractive market for European companies, the European institutions must be more open to the needs of the region.
A fresh start in EU relations with Brazil and Mexico could prove promising because of the impact it could have on other countries.
But accompanying measures must be taken to keep all Latin American countries on board.
Otherwise, Latin America may turn out to be Europe's next missed business opportunity.
A New Beginning for Europe
When Europe's leaders gather in Portugal to put the finishing touches to a new, slimmer Reform Treaty, it might help if they all pretend that the last 50 years of European integration have never happened.
Imagine what Europe needs to do to tackle its most urgent tasks, especially if it could do so without the political constraints of 50 years of EU history, in which agreements were negotiated and crumbling institutions built.
Let us also extend this fantasy journey and assume, though we could not fall back on half a century of inter-European cooperation in this EU scenario, that the nations that make up the EU at present would still be keen to take far-reaching joint decisions.
So let us cast aside our doubts and try to imagine what Europe could and should do to face some of the most profound and difficult political challenges that will determine whether the next 50 years will be as constructive as the last.
In other words, let us look at our problems in the light of the existing mechanisms and the EU's potential to adopt far-reaching new policies, and then ask ourselves why the EU is not using and delivering its own potential.
Broadly speaking, there are three areas where European leaders can do better at both national and EU level: global challenges, where Europe could take a more active lead; creating and strengthening human capital within the EU and globally; and improving the effectiveness of the EU's political machine itself.
Europe needs a clearer global agenda with a higher profile.
It needs to significantly strengthen its leadership in climate policy by setting much stricter EU targets and then using its influence in the international economy and trade to push for new global emission standards that are considered sensible from a scientific perspective.
On conflict and security issues, Europe should enter a new phase in which it adopts a clear and unambiguous position on various issues, from nuclear proliferation to sanctions against the military regime in Burma.
It should establish Europe as a strong and just actor on the world stage, rather than as a universal church in which different views coexist.
The aim should be to combine soft power tools, such as EU development aid and economic partnerships, with a growing sense of Europe's political and security reach to ensure that Europe can be counted on as a global player.
This, of course, means that the EU should seek to broaden its transatlantic thinking so that the EU and the United States can work more closely together to define and protect their common interests in a world in which they together make up little more than 10% of the total population.
These points are far from being a general criticism of the EU's efforts to develop a common foreign and security policy.
But they should underscore what many people in Europe know well, namely that the pace at which problems in international development and conflicts are growing has so far been far faster than the EU's policy responses.
Building up more human capital in Europe and globally is an extremely important part of the EU's future activities.
Education is by far the most profitable investment for Europe, so it should launch the most ambitious strategy ever to create a new knowledge dynamic and jobs in the EU, while at the same time helping to greatly improve education in the world's poorest countries.
Europe must also finally take the bull by the horns of immigration policy, a problem that has eluded generations of leaders.
EU-wide immigration rules must be adopted to reconcile Europe's shrinking appetite for imported labor with widespread fear of intercultural tensions and social unrest.
It will not be easy to create a fairer and more multicultural Europe, but if this problem is not addressed openly, the price will be even higher.
For the same reason, European governments should resolutely make a new attempt to strengthen Europeans "sense of their shared history and values.
A stronger European identity is the best basis for creating a more multicultural society, which demographers consider inevitable.
Meanwhile, doubts still surround the political and institutional machinery that the EU needs to achieve these and other ambitious goals.
The agreement on a Reform Treaty to revise the EU's decision-making mechanisms was welcomed with a sigh of relief in the middle of the year, but it is still uncertain whether the new Treaty will survive the ratification process in 27 countries.
However, we believe that the increased use of qualified majority voting by member governments, which has been incorporated into the new Treaty, should also apply to the ratification process itself.
If a small minority of EU governments were then unable to ratify the Treaty, it would not be thwarted in the same way as its predecessor, the Constitutional Treaty, did in 2005.
Do the world's coral reefs have a future?
Coral reefs are one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems in the oceans. They are home to some of the most beautiful creatures that exist.
More than ten million people rely on coral reefs as an important source of protein.
Activities around these reefs (especially fishing and tourism) are the livelihoods of many millions more people.
It is clear that a worldwide collapse of these ecosystems would also be a disaster for human beings.
However, the global decline of coral reefs has already reached dramatic proportions.
In some places, reefs have already been completely destroyed, and their possible worldwide destruction has become a real threat.
But there is also good news: we know what steps the international community can take today to protect the 'resilience' of reefs - that is, their ability to withstand environmental fluctuations that occur naturally in any ecosystem.
We need to tackle the scale of global warming while preserving the resilience of coral reefs.
Up to now, the main causes of reef decline have been overfishing and pollution, not global warming.
In healthy ecosystems, when the number of prey decreases, predators suffer from malnutrition, which also reduces their population, which in turn gives prey opportunities to regenerate.
But when man assumes the role of hunter, the proportions change. If the population of our prey decreases, their economic value increases and we fish even more intensively.
When the predator population is depleted, fishing shifts to herbivorous fish species, which also abruptly decimates the herbivores in the coral reefs.
Herbivorous fish play a central role in coral reefs.
When coral populations decrease as a result of hurricanes, diseases or other environmental influences, herbivores keep the growth of algae in check, giving corals the opportunity to recover.
Without these herbivores, the algae in the reef get out of hand, preventing the emergence of new coral populations.
Since corals provide habitat for other reef dwellers, coral reductions lead to a huge reduction in biodiversity in these reefs.
Pollution from fertilisers and toxins from agriculture on the adjacent mainland also reduces the chances of coral populations regenerating, giving algae an even greater competitive advantage.
Corals arise from the symbiosis between an animal and a single-celled plant.
The animal provides the plant with protection and nutrients; the plant converts sunlight into energy, which it in turn makes available to the animal.
For reasons that have not yet been fully clarified, this partnership breaks up at unusually high temperatures.
The plant is expelled and the coral takes on a shiny white color.
If the temperature quickly returns to normal, the partnership can be restored.
But if the corals have been bleached for too long, they die.
For many coral species, this threshold of bleaching is only a few degrees above the usual maximum temperature for a specific location.
Even assuming the most favorable scenario for global warming, this is a disturbing fact.
With constant thresholds for coral bleaching, the expected summer temperatures will regularly exceed these values in just a few decades.
Corals grow only slowly and in reefs with severe bleaching damage bleaching occurs before the corals have regenerated.
Fortunately, there is evidence that these fading thresholds can change.
Most coral species are geographically widespread and bleach at different locations at different temperatures.
Numerous coral species that bleach at 28oC or 29oC in Australia's Great Barrier Reef can withstand temperatures of 34oC or more in the Arabian Sea.
Unfortunately, we do not know how long such an adjustment process will take.
Two things can be done to protect coral reefs.
Firstly, and this is quite clear, we must curb global warming by, for example, meeting the emission targets of the Kyoto Agreement.
Secondly, we need to increase the ability of coral reefs to cope with environmental change and strengthen their resilience by protecting fish stocks, which keep the algae in check, thereby facilitating the recovery of corals after bleaching.
These recovery phases allow for improved adaptation to higher temperatures.
Without fish, algae growth prevents this recovery.
The catastrophic depletion of global fish stocks - in coral reefs and elsewhere - has taught the fishing industry some lessons.
Many intensively regulated fishing areas can no longer be fished, as can unregulated ones.
There is therefore a growing consensus that existing fisheries rules need to be extended by a system of no-fishing zones.
In these no-fishing zones, fish stocks are regenerating to such an extent that fishing results are also improving outside the no-fishing zones.
More importantly, however, these zones will become refuges for fish stocks, a kind of insurance policy against the destruction of the stock.
In coral reefs, these bans can help maintain habitats for healthy fish stocks, which in turn ensures the resilience of coral reefs.
We know from scientific research that 30-50% of the available habitat would have to be designated as no-fishing zones in order to achieve this effect.
This is far more than is currently being done to protect reefs, even in the wealthiest countries with coral reefs, such as the US or Australia, where this figure is 5%.
Given the scale of the threat to the world's coral reefs, the international community is reacting terribly slowly.
But there is also encouraging news: in June, the Australian government announced an extension of the fishing ban zones in the Great Barrier Reef to more than 30%.
If this measure is enforced, it could set a new global standard that other nations may adopt.
The future of tropical marine ecosystems, including those of millions of people, will depend on it.
An unprecedented future
JERUSALEM At nearly 90, I can't remember a time when the past was so irrelevant to political decision-making.
None of the major developments of the present were foreseen by anyone.
Experts examined the past, but, trapped in old paradigms, they could not deduce the future from it.
Due to the dynamic complexity of today's world, in which even more events are interdependent in the face of a scientifically based and rapidly changing global economy, we are unable to predict the future on the basis of linear extrapolation of the past.
The only certainty is that the future will be determined by scientific progress and innovation, which cannot be known in advance.
As a result, the traditional power of states and leaders is diminishing, and in today's globalized economy, it is innovators, not politicians, who wield the greatest influence.
The globalised economy affects all states, and yet no single state can determine the outcome, because science and technology are boundless.
Global companies want to do business all over the world, which, while affecting sovereignty, weakens racism and prejudice, and significantly weakens nationalism.
As a result of this change, the world's fortunes are now in the hands of a younger generation, more technologically savvy than their parents, and connected to each other through social networks that transcend national borders, language barriers, or different forms of government.
The young founders of Facebook and Google wield greater global influence than many heads of state and generals.
These young people are also the spearhead of emerging political protest movements.
The Arab Spring, tent demonstrations in Israel, Occupy Wall Street and protests in Russia mark a clash of generations, not a clash of civilisations.
The younger generation knows that the way states and economies are now run is unfit for the new times.
But there are political free riders who want to take advantage of this recent awakening, not by advancing an agenda of freedom, but by introducing new kinds of coercion.
In the Arab world, it is mainly Islamist extremists who are capturing the protests of the young generation and thus stealing the revolution from them.
Israel has responded positively to the will of the younger generation, but it cannot and should not interfere in the events of the Arab world.
Our hearts go out to the rebelling young people and their legitimate desire for freedom and fundamental rights to make themselves heard, to elect their political leaders and to make a living.
Israelis are waiting for the day when their country will no longer be the only democracy in the region, because living as an island of prosperity in a sea of poverty is unnatural.
But there is a serious concern that politically well-organized extremists are trying to gain control of less well-organized liberals in elections, thereby preventing peace and stability.
Radical fundamentalists cannot offer real solutions to the region's fundamental problems.
The current social upheavals threaten their way of life, which includes discrimination against women and a ban on modern education.
But only fundamental reforms of traditional authority can pave the way to freedom and growth.
Israel can serve as an example to others when it comes to achieving economic prosperity and social freedom, because its success lies in the fact that it had absolutely nothing at the beginning.
When we returned home, we were rich in history, but poor in natural resources.
All we could do was rely on our human capital.
That is why we invested in education and science, which is why we now have the highest percentage of scientists and patents per capita.
About 95 percent of our agriculture is based on high technology.
We use less water and yet have higher yields per square metre of cultivated land than any other country in the world.
What Israel succeeds can be achieved by others.
We are happy to offer our help wherever it is desired.
Together and in peace with our neighbours, we can build a region of hope, development and success.
Above all, we must do everything in our power to end the conflict with the Palestinians.
Israel was not created to rule over another people, and that is not Israel's destiny.
We are sincerely interested in the creation of a Palestinian state that exists peacefully and side by side with Israel - the democratic state of the Jewish people.
For us, peace is both a moral imperative and a national security strategy, because resolving the conflict would help stabilize the region by neutralizing extremists bent on manipulating grassroots movements to advance their radical agenda.
The international community can support these efforts by providing incentives to those countries that seek freedom and progress.
At the same time, decisive and groundbreaking political action must be taken against the extremists.
Iran, in particular, is a source of moral depravity, fostering extremism and blocking reform, crushing legitimate protests by its own citizens, and working against the brave Syrians who are now fighting for their freedom.
Iran also uses several proxies to incite terror against moderate forces in the Palestinian Authority, Lebanon and Iraq.
If Iran succeeds in acquiring nuclear weapons, its leaders could shake the Middle East and stir up even more extremism and violence.
Israel will defend itself if Iran continues to demand the destruction of Israel.
But it is not only Israel that is under threat.
Iran is a threat to peace and stability around the world.
The world's democracies have declared that they will not allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons, and it is their duty to honour that commitment before that is no longer possible.
Beyond these short-term challenges, we all have a duty to fundamentally change the way we prepare our children to deal with today's world.
At a time when the past has become irrelevant to the prognosis of the future, education must offer all children the opportunity to fulfil their potential.
Today's teachers should inspire our children to be creative and innovative.
Self-expression is as important as freedom of expression
I am writing this article at the age of 88, but not because I have learned from experience.
On the contrary, experience is overrated and often limits the courage needed to face the future and create an unprecedented new world.
The future is already there. Looking back makes no sense.
A wheeze from Europe
French President Jacques Chirac has alarmed the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
The French President has accused them of being "childish" and "irresponsible" to say that they stand behind the US on Iraq, and he has taken the opportunity to warn them that their position is in jeopardy because the decision to admit them to the EU has not yet been ratified.
It really was a broadside.
Then the French president took on the role of a kindergarten teacher for what he called the "poorly behaved" candidate countries, telling them that they had behaved "naughtily" and had missed a "good opportunity to shut up."
Those remarks will worry anyone who remembers how 40 years ago President Charles de Gaulle slammed Europe's door in the face of the British when they applied to join the European Community - the General thought the British were too closely linked to the US to join the European family.
But let us put things in perspective: Jacques Chirac is not Charles de Gaulle; and Europe has gone way beyond the time when its agenda was unilaterally set by France.
President Chirac's presumptuous role as an expert in diplomatic good behavior cannot be taken seriously, even by those of us who know (and love) France.
Instead, Chirac's outburst can best be explained as a sign of frustration with the fact that French influence in the EU is evaporating.
Like King Lear after the loss of his kingdom, France remains nothing but impotent rage in the face of its diminishing influence.
But the dispute in Europe goes further than the fact that France's primacy has faded.
I have always been sceptical when talking about the EU's' common 'foreign policy.
How can a country such as, say, France be expected to accept being outvoted by its EU partners on vital foreign and security issues?
At best, Europe should hope for a "more common" foreign and security policy, even if this does not yet answer Henry Kissinger's old question: Who do you have to call if you want to talk to "Europe"?
I have long worked towards an "even more common" foreign policy within the EU.
That is why I am concerned about today's split within the EU, as well as between some Member States and the US, over the Iraq issue.
When eight European leaders issued their appeal to resolve the growing transatlantic rift, they were accused of undermining European unity.
Nothing could be more outlandish.
They merely exposed the lack of unity that already existed.
It all began last fall, when German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, in a desperate bid to hold on to power, made Iraq an issue in Germany's election campaign.
He played on Germany's well-known and decent yearning for peace.
But by declaring that he would not participate in combat operations against Iraq under any circumstances, he undermined the UN's efforts to build maximum pressure behind its disarmament demands on Iraq.
France then embraced Germany.
France's foreign policy paths are often opaque and difficult to decipher, unless it is crystal clear where France sees its interests.
Normally, France wants to keep its options open.
But when the French and Germans celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the Élysée Treaty last month, France seemed to have cornered itself by supporting the Germans "view.
All this took place without consultation between the French and German governments and their partners within the EU.
It was a display of the special relationship between France and Germany that has been the driving force of European integration for so many years.
The history of Franco-German reconciliation is indeed impressive.
But it can no longer be taken for granted that other EU countries will automatically ratify the agreements that these two have forged among themselves as the guiding light of common policy.
This is especially true when they aim to create an "alternative" to American leadership in security policy.
The enlargement of the EU by a number of Central and Eastern European countries will increase resistance to Franco-German initiatives in this direction.
The letter from the eight European leaders - and the subsequent statement by the Vilnius Ten Group of Central and Eastern European countries - shows that France (and Germany) cannot dictate a European agenda that leads to a transatlantic rift.
This has obviously caused frustration.
But that shouldn't have surprised anyone.
The rupture between the EU and NATO has increased the risk of armed conflict with Iraq by weakening pressure on Iraq to comply with UN resolutions.
Chirac and Schröder do not seem to understand this.
This was therefore not one of Europe's great moments, especially since the EU's competent meeting is discussing a text that calls on EU governments to "actively and unreservedly support the unification's common foreign policy."
The German abbreviation for the EU's "common foreign and security policy" is CFSP, "gasp."
That seems an entirely appropriate expression of what we have observed.
An education à la Gaza
GAZA This was supposed to be my first year of medical school.
Instead, I am stuck here in Gaza, in my father's house, in the Jablia refugee camp, where there are few options and no way out.
After finishing high school last year, I decided to become a doctor.
Gaza needs bone specialists, but the training is only available abroad.
When I got a place at a medical school in Germany, my parents were proud.
I was excited to follow my older brother, who was already studying there.
In February, the German authorities gave me an entry visa.
I wasted no time and immediately applied to the Israeli authorities for permission to leave for Europe.
But I was told that only patients who needed treatment abroad as medical emergencies were granted permission to leave.
Hundreds of other young people stuck in the Gaza Strip have been offered a place to study abroad.
For many of us, this is our only way to continue our education.
The Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated regions in the world, and one of the poorest 1.5 million of us live on a piece of land that is 41 kilometers long and 6 to 12 kilometers wide.
Local hospitals lack the equipment they need to perform many important procedures, such as radiation therapy for cancer patients and heart surgery.
Universities in Gaza are overcrowded and lack material.
Many subjects are not even taught, and there are few postgraduate courses.
Foreign lecturers are not allowed to enter the Gaza Strip.
Without travelling abroad, we cannot learn.
After the United States pressured Israel to allow students who received a Fulbright scholarship to leave Gaza, the Israeli military announced in June that it would issue exit permits to a few more students with recognized scholarships, but not to hundreds.
So hundreds of us continue to wait, most without prestigious scholarships that could draw the world's attention to them.
I am sure that I will be one of the many who will not be allowed to leave.
Life in Gaza has dried up my optimism.
My father is a teacher and owns a children's clothing store.
My mother is a housekeeper.
I have six brothers and three sisters.
We returned to Palestine in 1996 from Saudi Arabia, where my father had worked as a teacher.
That was at the height of the peace process.
My parents had pinned their hopes on the Oslo Accords signed in 1993 and decided that they could give us a better life here.
But when I was ten, the second intifada began.
Throughout my teenage years, the peace process continued to collapse.
In my third year of high school, the Israeli authorities sealed off Gaza.
Israeli border controls have turned the flow of people crossing the border into a trickle, stifling Gaza's economy by choking off imports and exports and cutting fuel supplies and electricity.
In my father's shop, which was supposed to feed my brother and me during our studies, there are no clothes left.
With the support of the United States, Canada and the European Union, Israel is maintaining its blockade in an attempt to defeat Hamas, which won elections here in 2006.
But the blockade only makes people more desperate.
I know that Hamas and other armed groups have carried out rocket attacks from Gaza, killing civilians in Israeli towns and villages.
But I have also seen Israel strike back with air strikes and armed incursions into Gaza, including in Jabalia.
Israel's blockade amounts to collective punishment.
It harms all of us, whether we support Hamas or not.
It is also destroying my dream of adding an orthopaedic specialist to my name.
Sometimes I regret coming from Gaza.
But I still hope that I can go abroad, acquire skills there and will return to help others here.
Sometimes, when we have electricity, I see on TV how other people live in other places.
I wonder why they are able to travel, study and go on holiday when I am not even allowed to go abroad to study medicine.
We are students, not soldiers.
We are not fighters in this conflict.
Why doesn't Israel let us go to study?
Why do Europe and America support a blockade of young minds?
Soon my fellow students at the medical school will begin their training.
Women in Different Worlds
OXFORD <unk> Newsweek recently published the cover story of <unk>'s global women's progress report for 2011, with the top and bottom tiers sketching out two completely different worlds.
The top spots on <unk>'s top women's list are occupied by the usual suspects: Iceland, the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Canada.
In this world, countries score well over 90 out of 100 in the five categories of justice, health, education, economics, and politics.
More women than men have college degrees (USA), domestic violence perpetrators are evicted from their homes and monitored electronically (Turkey), and women are elected prime ministers (Denmark and Australia).
Now let's take a look at the other world, the worst countries for women.
In Chad, the bottom of the list, women have almost no legal rights, and girls as young as 10 are married, including Niger, the seventh worst country on the list.
In Mali, the fifth worst country, most women are traumatised by FGM.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, 1,100 women are raped every day.
In Yemen, every husband is free to beat his wife as often as he wants.
While it is disconcerting to see the contrast between these two worlds so starkly and in such detail, their existence is not news: development experts and human rights groups have been drawing attention to these inequalities for years.
But systemic oppression of women tends to be portrayed as a demand for empathy: we should not pursue this policy because it is not good, not enlightened.
Some development researchers argue that a country's aspirations to escape poverty are undermined by the oppression of women.
But the data in the Newsweek list show that we need to discuss this issue in stronger and more forceful language: when poor countries choose to oppress their women, they choose to some extent to perpetuate poverty.
The oppression of women is a moral issue, but it must also be seen as a choice by countries for short-term cultural convenience at the expense of economic and social progress.
It is politically incorrect to attribute any part of the suffering of very poor countries to their own decisions.
But the refusal not to blame many of them for their plight is patronising.
Clearly, the legacy of colonialism, widespread hunger, illiteracy, lack of property or redress, and lack of protection from state violence, is a major factor in contemporary poverty.
But how can we blame this legacy, while at the same time turning a blind eye to colonialism against women in the homes and public institutions of these countries?
If the poorest countries, most of them in Muslim-majority Africa, choose to maintain policies of oppression against women, or even devise new policies, we must also be willing to say that, to some extent, they are also opting for the economic misery that comes with it.
The silence of the developed world suggests that black and brown women are taken for granted by black and brown men, rather than having the same legal norms applied to all people.
<unk>'s surprise inclusion on the Newsweek list confirms that women's education boosts economic prosperity.
Many countries that have faced colonialism and other forms of tyranny in the past, like countries without rich mineral resources, have chosen to provide women with education and legal rights.
Some of these countries are still struggling economically, but none are really poor and some are experiencing a boom.
Consider China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, South Korea, and Turkey.
The low status of women in countries at the lower end of the scale cannot be put down to cultural gridlock: in many of the world's most surprising countries, such as Romania, Portugal, the Philippines and India, inequality between women was even more stark 50 to 100 years ago.
Today, marriage rape is not illegal in Pakistan, and there are 800 honor killings every year.
What kind of economic boom would stagnant Pakistan experience if it escaped the clutches of patriarchy?
If you have learned arithmetic, you can open a shop.
If you don't live in mortal fear of rape and beatings at home, you can organize people to dig a new well.
If your daughter is not subjected to FGM at the age of three and you marry her at ten, she can go to school, and if she later marries and has children of her own, they will benefit from two educated parents with jobs.
That means twice as many high-level conversations at home, twice as many contacts and twice as many encouragement to succeed.
Educated, ambitious mothers make all the difference.
As US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it in the Newsweek issue, "The world needs to think more strategically and creatively about harnessing female growth potential."
Studies show that helping women access trade and the economy also helps create jobs and raise incomes.
But in the worst countries for women, it is more socially acceptable to force frightened, uneducated women into their homes than to deal with the fact that this is a choice for generally declining incomes.
The Politics of the German Conservatives
Few policies are as elastic as' conservatism '.'
On one side of its spectrum of meaning, conservatism (for the past two decades) has been accused of promoting greed and greed too much.
On the other hand, conservatism has historically moved too close to the far right in many European countries.
Conservatism in today's Germany is shaped differently by the failure of the Weimar Republic than, say, in the Anglo-Saxon world.
This historical development gave rise to the conservatism practiced today by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU), which is oriented towards moderation and balance, preservation and innovation, as well as the occupation of the political centre in Germany.
With federal elections looming in Germany this fall, much will now be heard about the nature of German conservatism.
Some, citing the political focus of Edmund Stoiber, the CDU / CSU candidate for chancellor - the economic success of Bavaria - will try to attest to the union parties "dangerous closeness to the" anything goes "approach of American-style market conservatism.
Others, because of our emphasis on conservative social values, will think that we are just as state-patronising as the social democrats.
The truth, however, is far more complex and therefore more durable than these simple comparisons.
The basis for the CDU / CSU's understanding of politics is, of course, the concept of personal freedom, but we believe in individualism tempered by Western culture and Christian tradition.
We are sceptical about unbridled individualism, because we are aware of the guilt and the tendency to make mistakes on the part of the individual, but also of the historical mistakes and aberrations in the history of Germany in the 20th century.
Despite this deep-seated scepticism about human nature, the human capacity for progress and innovation also gives us confidence, as we recognize man's ability to correct mistakes and errors.
While these two traits seem contradictory, and certainly different from the values of American and British conservatives, together they provide a good basis for realistic pragmatism and a rejection of ideologically fixed politics - exactly the kind of politics that Germany needs now.
It refrains from trying to force people to be happy, and at the same time has a coordinate system that recognizes the need for boundaries - the boundaries of the state, the market, and each individual.
This understanding of politics seeks to resolve permanent contradictions, such as those between freedom and security, because the one is inconceivable without the other.
As little security without freedom makes sense, so little freedom is good without national and economic security.
It is on these principles that the social market economy is based, and we continue to defend it vigorously.
Competition as the most efficient order for the economic sphere of life and social balance through institutional provision for equal opportunities and solidarity, also in order to avoid the hypertrophy of an economization of all spheres of life.
The market as a tool and not as an answer to every human problem.
Recognising these facts, we are, for example, trying to strike a balance between economics and ecology, taking on a global responsibility for the environment, which is why we reject national solo initiatives when they are not compatible with the interests of the rest of the world.
This is why we see globalisation as a challenge and an opportunity, but at the same time we rely on institutions that foster proximity and identity, from the family and local and regional self-government to faith communities and voluntary work, which has been neglected in recent years.
The principle of subsidiarity provides the regulatory framework that allows the primacy of the level closer to the individual.
This is particularly important in view of our concept of a European Union, where we strive for a balance between nation and Europe.
Unlike our political opponents and so many others, we see European integration and national identity not as opposites, but as the two sides of the same coin.
The European Communities were created because it was recognised that certain objectives can only be achieved through cooperation.
Decades later, the European Union still needs the binding forces that nation states and historically grown regional structures convey to many people within these nation states for its legitimacy, because European self-conception is only gradually emerging and for a longer period of time alone is not sufficient to establish an order of freedom with a state monopoly on the use of force and a majority principle.
In essence, the form of government that we aspire to for Germany and the whole of Europe relies more on the morality of discourse and decision-making processes than on the permanent uniqueness of concrete solutions.
Indeed, only persistent scepticism about popular political "silver bullets" - both state and market fundamentalist - can foster pluralism and tolerance, and stem an excessive bureaucracy that weakens our economy.
In a rapidly changing world, this skepticism of the political center is the only reasonable position that a responsible political party and government can take.
Our policy approach pays tribute to this humane and realistic pragmatism, because it is the only way to ensure lasting stability and change against the temptations of the alternating baths of euphoria about progress and fear of the future.
This ensures moderation and tolerance as well as the ability to reform.
A German Europe?
LISBON / RIGA <unk> Is Europe post-euro crisis a German Europe?
During the euro crisis, power in general seemed to have shifted toward the capitals, and in particular toward one particular capital: Berlin.
But, faced with an introverted Germany, a downgraded France, and a half-absent Britain, the real news in European foreign policy is that the time has come for the little ones to outgrow themselves.
In this Europe today, the decisive initiatives take place not only in Berlin, Paris or London, but sometimes also in Stockholm or Warsaw.
And with major foreign policy problems on Europe's doorstep, whether in Egypt, Belarus or now Syria, useful European initiatives should always be welcomed, regardless of their origin.
Germany can take the lead in the EU in both foreign and economic policy if it wants to.
Together with Poland, Germany has initiated the EU's attempt to achieve a coordinated position vis-à-vis Russia and has shown strength vis-à-vis Serbia.
But elsewhere in Libya, for example, Germany has used its new room for manoeuvre, rather than taking the lead, to follow its own preferences over other EU members.
So today, the answer to Henry Kissinger's famous question of who he should phone if he wants to talk to Europe is not necessarily with the German Chancellor.
While Berlin is increasingly imposing its economic preferences on the other eurozone states, it is not prepared, as the example of Libya showed, to use military force as a foreign policy tool.
Moreover, the needs of its export sector appear to make Germany a global economic power.
By seeking to achieve its foreign policy objectives through economic means, the country is turning increasingly away from its European partners.
Meanwhile, even though France has lost economic power to Germany, it still plays a crucial foreign-policy role.
France has been at the forefront of the Libya operation, is similarly committed to strengthening sanctions against Iran, and supports the United States in Ivory Coast.
But France's unilateral approach often turns against its European partners.
For example, French President Nicolas Sarkozy prematurely claimed at the UN in September that he had adopted a common European position on the recognition of Palestine as a state.
In other words, France leads, but not always constructively.
Britain is increasingly marginalized in European foreign policy, aside from its pivotal role in Libya alongside France.
Even before vetoing Europe's plan for fiscal union at the European summit in December 2011, the country was playing a less leading role than in the past on crucial European foreign policy issues.
Britain has also supported enlargement of the EU, stronger ties with Turkey, and development in Africa, but has not been creative in integrating more member states or changing the European culture of discussion.
The UK has also often lagged behind on other issues such as engagement with strategic partners, notably China and Russia.
As the big three increasingly pursue their own narrow national interests, other EU member states are increasingly taking the lead in key foreign policy areas.
Sweden, for example, is 14th in population within the EU and eighth in GDP under Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and Foreign Minister Carl Bildt.
Last year, the country increased its annual financial assistance to North Africa by SEK 100 million (EUR 11.1 million), proposed an EU mission to support democratic efforts in Tunisia just a week after the revolution, and very early and strongly supported UN resolutions supporting the uprising in Libya.
Poland, too, is coming to the fore in foreign policy.
Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski have taken the lead, particularly on the EU's strategy toward Russia, where Poland has largely overcome its disagreements with Germany and is now at the forefront of efforts to achieve a truly comprehensive approach.
Poland has also been at the forefront of European defense (even though it did not participate in the military intervention in Libya).
This is in line with the strength of the Polish economy, which is expected to grow by more than 3% in 2012, more than almost any other eurozone member.
In these times of crisis, Germany may be attracting all the attention, but recent years have shown that Europe is most effective and influential when the small states get involved and make common cause with, or even lead, the big ones.
For example, Europeans (with the exception of countries like Greece) have agreed on a clear policy with common positions toward Iran, such as an oil embargo.
So, Poland and Sweden: Europe needs your leadership.
But in an EU with more than 500 million inhabitants, this may not be enough.
Other EU countries must follow suit if European foreign policy is to be truly effective and influential.
A German Shimmer in the Global Upswing
In 2004, global economic growth reached 5.1%, the fastest rate in the last 28 years.
While the Ifo indicator for the world economic climate, which is determined by quarterly surveys of 1,200 experts in 90 countries, deteriorated slightly during the first three quarters of 2005, it rose again in the last quarter, indicating a continuation of the upturn.
Growth in 2005 is estimated at around 4.3%, and a similar rate can be expected in 2006, which represents a period of sustained global growth not seen since the 1970s.
However, it is not a uniform recovery.
In the United States, there has been a decrease in the number of experts who consider the current situation favourable; a majority even believe that the economic situation will deteriorate over the next six months.
In Asian countries, however, including China, optimism remains undiminished.
The same is true of Eastern Europe, the former Soviet states, and Latin America.
The big surprise is Europe, which, unlike in 2004 and the first half of 2005, now seems to be catching up with the rest of the world.
While growth in the old members of the European Union was a paltry 1.5% in 2005, the Ifo Institute projects growth in the EU-15 to rise to 2.1% in 2006.
To be sure, economic performance will vary greatly from one EU country to another.
Whereas Italy will be the laggards with only 1.1% growth, the Ireland rocket will maintain its strength, boosting real GDP by about 4.8%.
In general, the big EU countries continue to perform poorly compared to the smaller members, which is hardly surprising when you consider that the EU is essentially an institution designed to help smaller countries overcome their size disadvantage by extending the agglomeration advantages that were once reserved for the larger countries.
But even Germany, Europe's largest economy, is booming.
The Ifo indicator for the economic climate in Germany, which is based on monthly surveys of 7,000 companies, recorded a sharp increase in the second half of 2005 and reached its highest level since the boom year of 2000; the current situation was assessed by companies as better and their expectations increased.
After five years of stagnation, the economy is finally moving.
The driving force is foreign demand, because as the world's second largest exporter, Germany is benefiting from the global boom.
Exports increased by 6.2% in 2005 and are expected to increase by 7.4% in 2006.
However, as we saw in 2004 and 2005, exports will not be sufficient to generate substantial growth if domestic demand does not follow suit.
The good news for Germany is that investment demand is now also growing.
While the second half of 2005 was already quite good, the Ifo Institute expects robust growth of 6% in the purchase of equipment and equipment for 2006.
After many years of contraction, investment in construction will also increase slightly.
Investment growth for the full year is expected to rise to 2.9%, weak by past standards, but still a promising balm for the battered German mood.
Moreover, any investment growth is crucial for Germany, which, according to the latest OECD statistics, is currently enduring the world's lowest share of net investment in national income.
Even if Germany remains the world's laggard, rising investment demand at all will contribute to GDP growth, which, according to the Ifo, is expected to increase by 1.7% in 2006.
Compared to most other countries, this figure seems small.
In fact, all EU countries except Italy and the Netherlands will grow faster.
But everything is relative: Germany's trend growth rate is only 1.1%, and it has been the slowest-growing EU country since 1995.
Judging by a disappointing past, even Germany is experiencing an economic upswing.
Even Germany's unemployment rate, which has been rising cyclically since 1970, will fall slightly in 2006, from 4.8 to 4.7 million.
The good economic figures will confirm initial positive impressions of Angela Merkel's new government, which made an excellent start at the EU summit, in which Merkel supported the negotiation of a compromise between Britain and France on the Union's budget for 2007-2013 (by increasing Germany's annual contribution by a further €2 billion).
The government may even have contributed a little to the good economic figures by announcing serious efforts to consolidate Germany's own public finances, a prerequisite for investor confidence.
According to the government, substantial tax increases will bring the deficit in the government budget below the 3% of GDP limit set by the Stability and Growth Pact by 2007, a target that has not been met for five consecutive years.
The real test for the German government is the labour market.
Most observers now agree that Germany needs something like the American Earned Income Tax Credit.
In Germany it is called "social welfare," but the principle is the same: the state should pay less for doing nothing and more for participating in the labour market.
This would expand the distribution of wages, create jobs, and maintain the living standards of the poor.
In her inaugural address to the Bundestag, Angela Merkel announced that her government would introduce such a system in 2006.
If this is more than lip service, and if it really undertakes a serious reform of the incentive structure of the German welfare state, it can lead to higher employment and structural economic growth.
In the long term, this would be more promising for the EU and the global economy than the demand-led outcome Germany is currently enjoying.
A Global Agenda for Seven Billion People
NEW YORK A baby will be born at the end of next month, the seventh billionth citizen on Earth.
We will never know the circumstances in which he or she is born.
What we do know is that the baby is entering a world that is subject to major and unpredictable changes in the environment, the economy, world politics, technology and demographics.
Since the founding of the United Nations in 1945, the world's population has tripled.
And it continues to grow, with land, energy, food, and water becoming increasingly scarce.
The global economy is also generating tensions: higher unemployment, widening social inequality, and the emergence of new economic powers.
These trends are increasingly connecting today's seven billion people.
The great global challenges of the twenty-first century cannot be solved by any nation alone, but only through international cooperation.
The 66th Session of the UN General Assembly offers the countries of the world another opportunity to move beyond narrow and short-term interests and to make a concerted effort to meet the long-term needs of all of humanity.
At a time when all nations face individual challenges, we must create a global agenda that helps the seven billionth baby and future generations grow up in a world of lasting peace, prosperity, freedom, and justice.
To contribute to such a future, I will focus my second term as Secretary-General on five global imperatives: five generational ways to shape tomorrow's world through today's decisions.
The first and greatest of these needs is sustainable development.
We must all understand that saving our planet, eradicating poverty and promoting economic growth are all one and the same struggle.
We need to link the issues of climate change, water scarcity, global health, food supply and women's empowerment.
Solving one problem must simultaneously contribute to solving all the other problems.
In the next five years, we must create a new economic vision for sustainable development and build a global consensus for a binding climate agreement.
Economic growth, the Millennium Development Goals and the fight against climate change all depend on us developing a new energy system for the 21st century and making it available to all people on the planet.
Another possibility is prevention as a framework of international cooperation.
This year, the UN peacekeeping budget will be $8 billion.
By avoiding conflict, we could save so much money, for example, by using political mediation missions instead of troops.
We know how that works.
We have had good experience of this in Guinea, Kenya and Kyrgyzstan.
A third necessity is to create a safer world.
To achieve this, we must be courageous in our commitment to democracy, human rights and peace.
This year, we have been very successful in restoring and securing peace in Ivory Coast, Darfur, Egypt and elsewhere.
But our vision of peace is still blocked by hatred and bloodshed.
In the Middle East, we need to break the stalemate.
The Palestinians deserve their own state.
Israel needs security.
Both want peace.
All of this can be achieved through negotiations and agreements, and the right platform for establishing such a peace is the United Nations.
We will also continue to work for democracy in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone.
And in the name of all humanity, we must strive for disarmament and non-proliferation in order to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.
The fourth great possibility is to support countries in transition, and this year's dramatic events in North Africa and the Middle East have inspired many people around the world.
Let us help make the Arab Spring a season of hope for all.
In Libya, we are deploying a new UN Assistance Mission to assist the country's transitional government in establishing a new administration and legal system to meet the needs of the Libyan people.
Our particular concern is Syria.
Violence and repression have escalated over the past six months.
The government has repeatedly promised to reform and listen to its people.
None of this has happened.
Global Unity Against Terrorism
When it comes to the United Nations, the current scandal surrounding the oil-for-food program and its impact on Secretary-General Kofi Annan's ability to lead the organization for the remainder of his one-and-a-half-year tenure immediately springs to mind.
But there is much more going on at the UN than investigations.
Reform is needed, in part because of the scandal, but also because of the United Nations "inability to address effectively the challenges in Rwanda, Kosovo, Iraq and, more recently, Sudan.
Even the UN's most ardent supporters now recognize that change is needed if the organization is to make a significant contribution to international peace and global security.
Some of these reforms concern the composition of the UN Security Council.
At present, the Security Council is a reflection of how the Second World War Allies imagined the postwar world and its leadership.
It also explains why much-weakened France was given a permanent seat on the Security Council, while Germany and Japan (and then-not-independent India) were left empty-handed.
Maintaining this old order is impossible; the need for change is beyond question.
However, it will be extremely difficult to achieve a solution with broad international support.
Britain and France will be reluctant to swap their respective seats for a single EU seat.
Admitting Germany as a permanent member would also exacerbate the problem of the relative over-representation of Europe.
Pakistan would oppose India as a permanent member of the Security Council, Argentina, Chile, and Mexico would oppose Brazil, Nigeria would oppose South Africa (and vice versa), and several countries, including China, Indonesia, and South Korea, would object to a permanent seat for Japan.
Resolving the problems of the Security Council will, of course, require some political efforts, which will take time.
In the meantime, however, there are important things to be done.
It would make sense, for example, to follow one of the recommendations of the high-level panel supported by Annan, namely that all UN member states officially declare that terrorism has no place in today's world.
This project is more difficult than it sounds at first.
For far too long, the international community has tolerated terrorism - the politically motivated, deliberate killing of civilians and non-soldiers, sometimes for the following reason: one terrorist is another's freedom fighter.
The luxury of discussing whether terrorism was justified in some situations in the past is left to historians.
We don't afford that luxury.
Modern terrorism is too destructive to be tolerated or even supported.
Weapons of mass destruction - nuclear, biological and chemical - are destructive and no one can justify their use.
Moreover, the terrorist attacks on America in 2001 demonstrated that even items as simple as a carpet knife can become weapons of mass destruction if used specifically against the vulnerabilities of modern, globalized life.
Terrorism is even less justifiable in view of the many political opportunities that exist to pursue a political objective.
The Palestinians can determine their future relationship with Israel at the negotiating table, and can count on the support of America, Russia, Europe, and the UN.
Iraqis have elected their own political representatives and are in the process of writing their own constitution.
No one with reasonable objectives and a willingness to compromise can claim that terrorism is the only way to achieve these objectives.
The world has already taken some important steps against terrorism.
Through a dozen international treaties and numerous UN resolutions, governments have committed themselves to acting against hostage-taking, hijacking of civilian aircraft and terrorism more broadly.
Similarly, the mandate of the Financial Action Task Force, set up in 1989 to combat money laundering, has grown increasingly focused on stopping the financial flows of terrorists.
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373, adopted after the attacks of 11 September, calls on states not to harbor terrorists, to bring to justice anyone linked to terrorism, to prevent recruitment by terrorist groups and their efforts to acquire weapons, and to cooperate with other governments and international organizations in pursuing suspects and improving security.
But a new 13th agreement is still missing, closing the loophole that allows governments to decide what counts as terrorism and what does not.
There must be broad agreement that any deliberate killing of civilians and non-soldiers is unacceptable and that the perpetrators and their supporters must be punished.
Of course, such an agreement will not prevent all acts of terrorism in the future.
But the thought matters.
Terrorism must be discredited, just as slavery once was.
Governments and individuals will then think twice about siding with terrorists, and it should make it easier to gain support for international action against those who nonetheless carry out terrorist acts.
Early in our lives, we learn that the end does not justify the means.
It is time to put this lesson into practice before more innocent people lose their lives.
A Global Green New Deal
NAIROBI - Unemployment is soaring, bankruptcy filings are soaring and the stock market is in freefall: At first glance, it might seem reasonable to let the fight against climate change whizz by and put environmental investments on hold.
But this would be a disastrous mistake, with immediate and multi-generational consequences.
Far from further burdening an already overburdened and overstretched economy, environmental investment is exactly what is needed to get people back to work, fill the order books and help economies recover.
In the past, caring for the environment was seen as a luxury; today it is a necessity, a fact hitherto understood by some, but by no means all, economic architects.
Much of President Barack Obama's $825 billion stimulus package for the United States will go toward promoting renewable energy, insulating a million homes, and improving the country's ailing power grid.
These investments could create an estimated five million green jobs, give a boost to construction and engineering, and return America to the equally serious business of fighting climate change and achieving energy security.
The Republic of Korea, which is losing jobs for the first time in more than five years, has also seen the green streak on the horizon in these economically gloomy times.
President Lee Myung-bak's government plans to invest $38 billion in human employment to clean four major rivers and reduce disaster risks by building dams and water treatment plants.
Lee's plan also includes building environmentally friendly transportation networks, such as high-speed rail and hundreds of miles of bike lanes, as well as generating energy from waste methane from landfills.
The package also focuses on investment in hybrid car technologies.
Similar job-creating packages for a Green New Deal have been put together in China, Japan and the UK.
At a time of increasingly uncertain commodity prices and exports, they are just as important for developing countries in terms of jobs, poverty alleviation and creating new opportunities.
In South Africa, the government-funded Working for Water initiative, which employs more than 30,000 people, including women, young people and the disabled, also sees an opportunity in the crisis.
The country spends about $60 million a year fighting invasive alien plants that threaten native animals, water supplies, major tourist destinations, and farmland.
This work will certainly be extended as more than 40 million tonnes of invasive alien plants are harvested as fuel for power stations.
It is estimated that it will generate 500 megawatts of electricity, equivalent to 2% of the country's electricity needs, which will also create more than 5,000 jobs.
It is therefore clear that some countries now see environmentally friendly investments in infrastructure, energy systems, and ecosystems as the best thing to do for recovery.
Others may be uncertain about the potential benefits of investing in ecosystem services, such as carbon storage in forests, or in renewable energy, especially for the 80% of Africans who do not have access to electricity.
Others, on the other hand, simply do not know exactly how to follow this path.
In early February, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) will gather some of the world's leading economists at UN headquarters in New York.
The aim is to develop a strategy for a Global Green New Deal tailored to various national challenges to help world leaders and ministers put together multi-pronged stimulus packages.
The Global Green New Deal, which UNEP presented as a concept in October 2008, is a response to the current economic malaise.
But, if spent wisely, these stimulus packages could trigger far-reaching and transformative trends by creating the conditions for a more sustainable, much-needed green economy for the twenty-first century.
The trillions of dollars mobilized to respond to the current emergencies, together with the trillions of dollars of investors waiting behind the scenes, offer an opportunity that was unthinkable just 12 months ago: the opportunity to chart a more efficient and intelligent course in terms of resources that can address issues as diverse as climate change, natural resource scarcity, water scarcity, and biodiversity loss.
Pumping billions of current bailouts blindly into old industries and depleted economic models would mean throwing good money after bad while mortgaging our children's futures.
Instead, policymakers must use these unexpected resources to invest in innovation, promote sustainable businesses, and support new patterns of decent, long-term employment.
The Global Economy in Heavy Sea
NEW YORK It looks like dark financial and economic clouds are gathering from all sides: in the eurozone, the United States, China and elsewhere.
Indeed, finding refuge in the inhospitable global economy in 2013 may prove difficult.
For starters, the eurozone crisis is worsening, with the euro remaining too strong, early austerity deepening recession in many member countries, a credit crunch in the periphery, and high oil prices undermining prospects for recovery.
The eurozone banking system is being balkanized by cut-off cross-border and interbank credit lines, and capital flight could become a full-blown assault on peripheral banks if, as is likely, Greece makes a disorderly exit from the monetary union in the coming months.
Moreover, public finances and public debt are under increasing strain, as interest-rate spreads on Spanish and Italian bonds have once again reached unsustainable levels.
Indeed, the eurozone may need not only an international bailout of failing banks (as recently happened in Spain), but also the rescue of entire sovereigns, at a time when the international and eurozone umbrellas are insufficient to accomplish the task of stepping in for both Spain and Italy.
As a result, the possibility of a disorderly eurozone collapse remains.
Further west, the US economy is weakening: it grew by a paltry 1.9% in the first quarter, well below its potential.
Job creation stalled in April and May, so the pace of US growth could reach what Americans call "stall speed" by the end of the year: a kind of minimum speed needed to avoid slipping into recession.
The risk of a "double dip" recession after recession grows next year: Even if what looms in the US like a looming fiscal cliff turns out to be only a minor drag, likely tax increases and cuts to transfer payments will reduce growth in disposable income and consumption.
Moreover, the political deadlock over fiscal adjustment is likely to remain, regardless of whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney wins the presidential election in November.
Fresh arguments over the debt ceiling, the risks of a so-called government shutdown - a financial paralysis that will bring public administration largely to a standstill - and rating downgrades could further hurt consumer confidence and the business climate, drive down spending and accelerate a flight to safe levels that would exacerbate stock market falls.
In the east, China's unsustainable growth model could be underwater by 2013, as its investment bubble persists and reforms aimed at boosting consumption are too little and too late.
China's new leaders must accelerate structural reforms to reduce national saving and increase consumption's share of GDP. Intra-leadership disagreements over the pace of reforms, coupled with the likelihood of a bumpy political transition, suggest that reforms simply will not happen fast enough.
The slowdown in the US, the eurozone and China is already putting a massive brake on growth in other emerging markets because of their existing trade and financial links with the US and the European Union (so there has been no decoupling).
At the same time, the lack of structural reforms in emerging economies, coupled with their focus on increased state capitalism, is holding back the economy and will reduce these countries "resilience.
Finally, the long-simmering tensions in the Middle East between Israel and the US, on the one hand, and Iran, on the other, over nuclear proliferation, could reach a boiling point by 2013.
Current negotiations are likely to fail, and even further tightening of sanctions may not dissuade Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons development.
The US and Israel are unwilling to accept a policy of containment by deterrence against an Iranian state that maintains its nuclear program, and a military confrontation in 2013 would massively increase the price of oil and lead to a global recession.
The following risks are already exacerbating the slowdown: stock markets are falling everywhere, with negative wealth effects on consumption and investment spending.
The cost of borrowing for highly indebted countries is rising, restrictive lending threatens small and medium-sized enterprises, and falling commodity prices are depressing exporting countries "revenues.
Increasing risk aversion leads economic actors to take a wait-and-see approach, so the economy's slowdown is partly a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Compared to 2008-2009, when policymakers had ample room for maneuver, monetary and fiscal authorities are running out of political ammunition (or, more cynically, the political rabbits to pull out of their hats).
Monetary policy is constrained by near-zero interest rates and repeated rounds of quantitative easing.
Indeed, economies and markets no longer face liquidity problems, but rather credit and insolvency crises.
Meanwhile, unsustainable budget deficits and public debt in most advanced economies have severely limited the scope for further fiscal stimulus.
Boosting net exports via exchange rates is a zero-sum game at a time when private and public debt reduction is dampening domestic demand in countries running current-account deficits and structural problems are having the same effect in surplus countries.
After all, a weaker currency and a better balance of trade in some countries necessarily imply a stronger currency and a weaker balance of trade in others.
Meanwhile, the ability of banks and other financial institutions to step in, isolate, and rescue them is being constrained by policymakers and near-insolvent governments unable to absorb additional losses in their banking systems.
As a result, sovereign risk is now becoming bank risk.
Indeed, eurozone governments, in particular, are burdening their banks "balance sheets with a growing share of their debt.
To avoid chaos in the eurozone, the current austerity policies should be far more gradual, a growth pact should complement the new European Fiscal Compact, and a fiscal union in which EU states borrow jointly and severally (Eurobonds) should be implemented. In addition, a comprehensive banking union, starting with deposit insurance, should be established throughout the eurozone.
Unfortunately, Germany opposes all of these crucial policies, because it is fixated on the credit risks that its taxpayers would face through greater economic and fiscal integration and integration of the banking sector.
As a result, the likelihood of disaster in the eurozone is increasing.
The storm that has been brewing over the eurozone may be the heaviest that can break off, but it is not the only one threatening the global economy.
A Global Solution Network
NEW YORK -- Big societal changes are happening in different ways.
A technological breakthrough - the steam engine, computers, the internet - can play a big part in that.
Visionaries such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela can spark the desire for justice.
Political leaders can launch a major reform movement, as Franklin Roosevelt did with the New Deal.
Our own generation urgently needs to drive forward a new era of great social change.
This time, we must act to save the earth from an environmental disaster caused by humanity.
Each of us feels this challenge almost every day.
Heatwaves, droughts, floods, forest fires, shrinking glaciers, polluted rivers, and extreme storms are hitting the planet with dramatically increasing frequency due to human activity.
Our $70 trillion annual global economy is subjecting the natural environment to unprecedented pressures.
We will need new technologies, new behaviors, and a new ethic based on solid evidence to sustain further economic development.
In his unique position between global politics and society, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is taking up this unprecedented challenge.
At the political level, the UN is the meeting place where 193 member states negotiate and shape international law, as in the important treaty on climate change at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992.
At the level of the world community, the UN represents the citizens of the world, we, the peoples, as the UN Charter says, and at the societal level, the UN is about the rights and responsibilities of all of us, including future generations.
Over the past two decades, governments have failed to provide enough solutions to environmental threats.
Politicians have failed to implement properly the treaties concluded at the 1992 Environment Summit.
Ban knows that decisive action by governments remains crucial, but he also recognizes that civil society must also play a larger role, largely because too many governments and politicians have vested interests and not enough politicians think in terms of time horizons beyond the next election.
To empower the world community to act, Ban has proposed a bold new global initiative, for which I am grateful to volunteer.
The UN's Sustainable Development Solutions Network is a huge initiative to mobilize global knowledge to save the planet.
The idea is to use global knowledge and action networks to identify and demonstrate new, state-of-the-art approaches to sustainable development around the world.
The network will work with and support governments, UN agencies, civil society organisations and the private sector.
Humanity must learn new ways to produce and use low-carbon energy, grow food sustainably, build vibrant cities, and manage global commons such as the oceans, biodiversity, and atmosphere.
But time is running out.
Today's megacities, for example, already have to cope with dangerous heat waves, rising sea levels, more extreme storms, severe congestion, and air and water pollution.
Agricultural regions already need to become more resilient to greater climatic fluctuations.
And if a region in one part of the world finds a better way to meet transport, energy, water, or food needs, these successes should be quickly incorporated into the global knowledge base, so that other regions can benefit quickly.
Universities have a special role to play in the new UN knowledge network.
Exactly 150 years ago, in 1862, Abraham Lincoln created America's land-grant universities to help local communities improve agriculture and quality of life through science.
Today, we need universities in all parts of the world to help their societies meet the challenges of poverty eradication, clean energy and sustainable food supplies, and other challenges.
By networking and putting their curricula online, the world's universities can discover and disseminate scientific solutions to complex problems even more effectively.
The global corporate sector must also play a significant role in sustainable development.
At the moment, the business world has two faces.
It is the source of state-of-the-art sustainable technology, pioneering research and development, world-class management and leading ideas for environmental sustainability.
At the same time, however, the business sector is also lobbying aggressively with the aim of undermining environmental regulations, reducing taxes on companies and shirking its own responsibility for environmental degradation.
Sometimes the same company operates on both sides of this divide.
We urgently need farsighted companies to join the Sustainable Development Solutions Network.
These companies are particularly capable of translating new ideas and technologies into early-stage demonstration projects, thereby accelerating global learning cycles.
Equally important is a critical mass of respected business leaders who urge their peers to end the anti-environmental lobbying and campaign-finance practices that drive government inaction.
Sustainable development is a generational challenge, not a short-term one.
It will take decades, not years, to reinvent energy, food, transportation, and other systems.
But the long-term nature of this challenge should not leave us idle.
We need to start reinventing our production systems now, precisely because the road to change will be so long and the environmental dangers are already pressing.
At the Rio + 20 Summit last June, world leaders agreed to include new Sustainable Development Goals for the post-2015 period, building on the success of the Millennium Development Goals in combating poverty, hunger, and disease.
In the post-2015 period, the fight against poverty and the fight to protect the environment will go hand in hand and mutually reinforce each other.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has already launched several global processes to establish the new post-2015 goals in terms of openness, participation, and knowledge-based governance.
The creation of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network by the Secretary General is therefore particularly timely.
Not only will the world set new goals to achieve sustainable development, it will also have a new global network to share expertise and help achieve these critical goals.
Good rate rise for Europe
Wrongs and wrongs do not make a right.
Just because European governments have failed to provide decent care for their voters does not mean that the European Central Bank should fail in its task of promoting price stability in the eurozone as well.
This may sound obvious, but that is precisely what some European politicians advocate: abandoning price stability.
Italian politicians, for example, who seem least qualified to advise the ECB on monetary policy, given Italy's dismal economic performance of late, nonetheless favor interest-rate cuts.
Deputy Economy Minister Mario Baldassarri echoed comments made by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi last week when he told Il Sole 24 Ore that any efforts to boost growth would be futile if someone stepped on the brake pedal.
Who does he want to put in the bucket?
If anyone is putting the brakes on Italian growth, it's Berlusconi himself.
He made no effort to reform the economy during his term of office, and is now trying to blame the ECB for Italy's sluggish economic performance.
But it is precisely this lack of domestic economic reform that has made Italy one of the least competitive states in the European Economic Area.
There is more to this than the usual finger-pointing.
Pressure is mounting on the ECB to raise interest rates, and the attacks by Berlusconi and co. are an attempt to prevent future rate hikes and get the ECB to ease its monetary policy.
Rising energy prices, for example, have become a major inflation risk.
But higher energy prices alone will not induce the ECB to raise interest rates.
The key is so-called second-round effects, such as whether rising crude oil prices lead to higher wage demands by unions.
So far, the unions, as ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet likes to call them, have kept quiet.
But if that changes, the ECB will have to raise interest rates, even if European economic growth remains weak.
The good news is that economic growth seems to be recovering in the European Economic Area (even in Italy).
Although GDP growth in the second quarter was weak - the eurozone average was just 0.3% year-on-year - third-quarter data suggested a sustained economic recovery in the second half of the year.
Only consumption is lagging behind.
How will the ECB respond to better economic news?
Some members of the ECB's Governing Council are now uncomfortable that interest rates in the eurozone have remained so low, at 2%, for so long (more than two years).
While there is no short-term inflation problem, the ECB's monetary policy is based on a medium-term timescale.
A particular concern is that the eurozone's money stock is well above the ECB benchmark, suggesting excess liquidity.
The ECB is unlikely to raise interest rates to curb over-liquidity as long as economic recovery remains uncertain.
Slow growth has silenced the monetarists on the Governing Council.
However, this will change as soon as the economic recovery is confirmed.
Interest-rate hikes are likely to come sooner rather than later, which is why Berlusconi and French President Jacques Chirac are now calling for interest-rate cuts.
In the meantime, Germany's elections in September could have surprising consequences for the ECB's monetary policy.
Angela Merkel, the Christian Democrats "candidate, is a reformer, a beacon of hope for Germany's future and the future of Europe.
Unfortunately, Merkel's campaign has had a difficult start, and the recent entry of Oskar Lafontaine's extreme Left Party into the fray may necessitate the formation of a grand coalition between the CDU and the SPD.
That would be bad news for the German economy, which could delay a possible ECB interest-rate hike.
With the expected gridlock in parliament making reforms less likely, companies could postpone investment until later, with consumers likely to keep their wallets closed, because official policy would be even more unclear than it is now.
By contrast, a centre-right coalition between the CDU and the Free Democrats could push the ECB into action.
This brings us to an interesting point.
The public should be relieved when the ECB raises interest rates, because that would most likely signal that the long-awaited economic recovery is already underway and that inflationary effects are being addressed.
In other words, an increase would indicate that something good is happening.
But the public often sees interest-rate hikes as a negative event that increases unemployment and stifles growth.
Politicians like Berlusconi, who like to pass the buck to others and have not served voters decently themselves, their media lackeys, and Keynesian economics professors who do not understand and misinterpret Keynes, support this distorted view.
Europe would be much better off if someone told the public the truth.
A grand bargain with Iran
The specter of a nuclear-armed Iran haunts Arabs and Israelis alike, but the US and Israel, in particular, are proving to be the driving force behind efforts to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.
The key to the problem and its possible solution lies in the triangle between America, Iran, and Israel.
Although Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution in 1979 shattered the old alliance between Israel and Iran, economic relations between the two countries remained strong, with America's blessing.
The Iran-Contra affair of the 1980 "s, when Israel sold arms to the Islamic Republic to fight Iraq, is a case in point.
Israel and Iran, two non-Arab powers in the midst of a hostile Arab environment, had fundamental common interests that the Islamic revolution could not change.
In the early 1990 "s, during Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's tenure, the collapse of the Soviet Union and a changed strategic environment following America's victory in the first Gulf War plunged Israel and Iran into open conflict.
The U.S.-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace process, which produced a series of stunning successes - the Madrid peace conference, the Oslo accord, Israel's peace treaty with Jordan, a near rapprochement with Syria, and Israel's progress in relations with Arab states from Morocco to Qatar - has proved a worst nightmare for an increasingly isolated Iran.
At this turning point, Israel and Iran, two powers competing for supremacy in a rapidly changing Middle East, decided to give their strategic competition an ideological framework.
The conflict was now between Israel, an exemplary democracy in the fight against the spread of an obscurantist Shiite empire, and Iran, which decided to secure its revolution by mobilizing Arab masses in the name of Islamic values and protecting them against infamous rulers who had betrayed uprooted and dispossessed Palestinians.
Since the mullahs are less hostile to Israel itself than to Israeli-Arab reconciliation, their inflammatory anti-Jewish, pan-Islamic rhetoric aims to end Iran's isolation and present its regional ambitions in a light that makes them acceptable to the Sunni masses.
In an Arab Middle East, Iran is a natural enemy; in an Islamic world, it is a potential leader.
Ironically, Iran is the main promoter of Arab democracy, because the best way to undermine the power of incumbent regimes is to promote popular Islamist movements such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas in Palestine, and the Shiite majority in Iraq.
Yitzhak Rabin believed that an Israeli-Arab peace would prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, but now his nightmare seems to be fast becoming a reality.
As an anti-status quo power, Iran is pursuing the expansion of its nuclear capabilities not to destroy Israel, but to gain prestige and influence in a hostile environment, and to underpin its challenge to the regional order.
But Israel has every reason to be concerned that a nuclear-armed Iran would undermine Zionism's promise to secure a sanctuary for Jews, the founding principle of Israel's strategy of nuclear uncertainty, and would also embolden its enemies across the region.
There would also be uncontrolled nuclear proliferation in the region, with Saudi Arabia and Egypt leading the way.
A military attack on Iran's nuclear facilities would be too dangerous and its outcome uncertain.
And no matter how tough economic sanctions are, they would not bring Iran to its knees.
It is also unclear whether a split between revolutionary purists and the merchant mentality of the Iranian elite would lead to regime change in the near future.
But being radical does not automatically mean being irrational, and revolutionary Iran has often demonstrated its pragmatism.
In the American-Iranian equation, it was the US, not Iran, that pursued rigid ideological diplomacy.
Iran supported the US during the first Gulf War, but was not included in the Madrid peace conference.
Moreover, Iran supported America in its war against the Taliban in Afghanistan.
And when US forces overran Saddam Hussein's army in the spring of 2003, encircled Iran made the US an offer for wide-ranging talks that should have addressed all contentious issues, from nuclear ambitions to Israel, from Hezbollah to Hamas.
The Iranians also promised an end to the blockade of the Israeli-Arab peace process.
But neoconservative hubris - "We are not talking to evil" - ruled out a pragmatic response to Iran's initiative.
The mood in Iran changed after America's entire Middle East strategy failed, but this far-reaching offer of a grand bargain remains the only way out of the impasse.
But this will not be achieved by an inevitably flawed sanctions regime, or by America's use of the Cold War logic to break Iran's backbone by pushing it into a ruinous arms race.
Iran's growing regional influence stems not from military spending, which is far less than that of its enemies, but from its challenge to America through cunning use of its soft power.
The best way to stop Iran's strategy of regional destabilization is a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace agreement, accompanied by massive investment in human development, followed by an internationally promoted peace and security system in a demonstrably nuclear-free Middle East that includes Israel.
A Gravity Test for the Euro
CAMBRIDGE - I know that exchange rates are never easy to explain or understand, but I find the euro's relatively robust exchange rate today somewhat mysterious.
Do the gnomes in the currency markets seriously believe that the euro's last comprehensive bailout will last for more than a few months?
The new plan relies on a questionable mix of dubious fiscal gimmicks and vague promises of modest Asian engagement.
Even the best part of the plan - the proposed (but not really agreed) haircut of 50% for holders of Greek private-sector debt - is not enough to stabilise the country's profound debt and growth problems.
So how is it that the euro is trading at a 40% premium to the US dollar, even as investors continue to view southern European government bonds with deep skepticism?
I can think of one very good reason why the euro must fall, and six less convincing reasons why it should remain stable or appreciate.
Let's start with why the euro must fall.
In the absence of a clear path to much closer fiscal and political union, which can only be achieved through constitutional change, the Eurosystem's current middle ground seems increasingly untenable.
It seems clear that the European Central Bank will be forced to buy much larger quantities of (highly speculative) eurozone government bonds.
This may work in the short term, but if sovereign default risks manifest themselves, which my research with Carmen Reinhard suggests is likely, the ECB will now have to recapitalise itself.
And if the stronger northern eurozone countries are not willing to swallow this transfer, and political resistance is strong, the ECB may be forced to recapitalise itself through money creation.
Either way, a severe financial crisis is highly likely.
Against this background, what arguments support the current value of the euro or its further rise?
First, investors may be persuaded that Europe's northern countries will effectively push out the weaker countries, creating a super-euro.
There may be some truth in this, but any eurozone breakup would certainly be highly traumatic, and the euro would crash before its hull shape recovered.
Second, investors might remember that the fallout from the financial panic of 2008, when the dollar was at its epicenter, radiated so far that, paradoxically, the US currency actually rose in value.
While it may be hard to imagine the way forward, a severe euro crisis could well have a snowball effect in the US and elsewhere.
It is possible that the transfer could take place via US banks, many of which remain vulnerable, owing to their thin capital base and huge mortgage portfolios that are well above market value.
Third, foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds may be interested in further euro purchases to hedge risks to the US and its own economies.
Government investors are not necessarily driven by yield-maximization considerations that motivate private investors.
But if the real reason for the strength of the euro lies in demand from foreign governments, there is a risk that these foreign sovereign buyers will eventually flee the euro, just as private investors would only do so more quickly and in a more concentrated manner.
Fourth, investors may believe that US risks are ultimately as great as Europe's.
It is true that the US political system appears to be stalled in developing a plan to stabilize budget deficits in the medium term.
While the US Congressional Supercommittee tasked with crafting a fiscal consolidation package is likely to come up with a proposal, it is far from clear whether Republicans and Democrats will be willing to accept a compromise in an election year.
Investors may also be worried that the US Federal Reserve could step in with a third round of quantitative easing, pushing the dollar lower.
Fifth, the current value of the euro on a purchasing-power basis does not seem too out of place; an exchange rate of $1.4 to the euro is cheap for Germany, an export power that would probably be able to cope with a much stronger euro.
For the eurozone's southern periphery, however, the euro's current exchange rate is already difficult to manage.
Whereas a German company persuaded its employees to accept wage cuts in order to weather the financial crisis, wages in the peripheral countries of the South have risen steadily, despite stagnant productivity.
But, because the euro's aggregate value must represent a balance between the north and south of the eurozone, it can be argued that a rate of 1.4 is within a reasonable range.
Finally, it may simply be that investors believe that the eurozone's current plan will work, even if a dozen plans have failed before.
Abraham Lincoln is credited with saying: 'You can always fool some people and sometimes fool others, but you cannot fool all people all the time.'
So there are plenty of vaguely plausible reasons why, despite its protracted crisis, the euro has remained so firm against the dollar.
But don't count on a stable euro-dollar exchange rate next year, let alone an even stronger euro.
A Greek quandary
BUENOS AIRES <unk> Tough times lead to desperate measures.
The latest bailout package against Greece's insolvency includes a bond buyback to ease the country's debt burden.
Ultimately, this is debt restructuring by the back door: the European rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), lends Greece money that allows it to buy back its own debt on the secondary market at a large discount, resulting in losses for bondholders but not default.
In the debate on the European debt crisis, there is constant talk of precedents in Latin America.
Indeed, many countries made similar debt buybacks there in the late 1980 "s.
A classic example is Bolivia's repurchase of nearly half of the country's bad debt in 1988, financed by international lenders.
But the Latin American experience with debt repurchases, most relevant to our case, came later and received much less attention: Ecuador in 2008.
President Rafael Correa had been toying with the possibility of bankruptcy since the 2006 presidential election campaign (the refusal to pay was part of his election program), which soon earned the country a CCC rating from Fitch.
The reasons cited by Correa (legal concerns about how the bonds were issued during the debt restructuring in 2000) missed the point.
The threat of default served to drive down bond prices in secondary markets, only to buy them back through the back door at a discount.
That task was taken over by Banco del Pacífico, which bought Ecuadorian securities on the verge of bankruptcy at about 20 cents on the dollar face value, low enough for a deep haircut, but high enough to keep vulture investors away.
To speed things up after the sovereign default in December 2008, Ecuador concluded the buyback with a cash auction for the remaining bondholders, rather than a regular exchange, where the legality of secret purchases would likely have been called into question.
After institutional bondholders were forced to sell in the midst of the Lehman Brothers sell-off and most of the securities were in benevolent hands, the action was successfully completed.
There are some lessons to be learned from this episode about debt buybacks.
The first is about market reaction.
Given recent developments in Ecuadorian bond yields, markets do not seem to have punished the country's behavior: Ecuador, an oil exporter that benefited from the 2009 oil-price recovery, was able to return to capital markets shortly after the debt buyback.
This is all the more remarkable because Ecuador was probably the first country in recent history to default not because of insolvency, but because of unwillingness to pay.
The second lesson, which is the most important for Europe today, concerns the crucial role played by actual bankruptcy.
Almost two years of sustained threats from Correa were not enough to get a significant discount on the bonds.
Ecuador had to wait until the credit event in December 2008 to buy back the bonds at bargain prices.
The assumption that only an actual default will lead to significant private-sector involvement (i.e., that private bondholders will have to take a hit) is borne out by the comparison of Uruguay's market-friendly debt restructuring in 2003 with Argentina's draconian restructuring in 2005.
What the Uruguay authorities called a voluntary measure did not result in nominal valuation reductions and did not lead to any significant debt relief. In Argentina, a four-year postponement of payments resulted in debt relief of more than 50%.
So the question arises: how can private bondholders be persuaded to sell their Greek bonds when a reliable buyer is behind them in the event of an emergency?
If Europe provides money credibly to buy back all Greek debt, the risk premium on the bonds would disappear, and private investors would be completely off the hook.
Only the possibility of a default and the motivation to avoid even deeper cuts can persuade investors to liquidate their holdings at a discount.
The buy-back can only succeed if the market sees it as the last chance to prevent unilateral restructuring.
In other words, a precondition for a successful buyback is bankruptcy.
Can Greece reduce its debt with the help of the EFSF while avoiding default?
Small purchases at today's vulture-style panic prices are always possible, but do not bring significant debt relief.
Large purchases would drive up prices on the secondary market and render the whole action pointless.
And the opaque Ecuadorian methods are not possible in Europe, both for legal reasons and because a transaction of this size can hardly be hidden or carried out by third parties.
But what if the EFSF transparently imitated Banco del Pacífico, for example, by imposing a limit on the spread above which it would finance the repurchase of all Greek bonds?
Of course, the interest premium would automatically approach that limit, but how much would be sold?
Would the EFSF reduce Greek debt at bargain prices or serve as insurance for current bondholders?
If the interest limit were set high to achieve a significant discount, the repurchase would reduce only a small amount of debt.
Capping interest rates would limit the risk of losses, which could tempt people to hold the bonds and wait for prices to rise, which may be a good reason to limit the supply.
By contrast, if the limit is set low enough to bring interest spreads down from their panic levels, larger purchases are expected, but, unfortunately, the actual haircut that private creditors would have to bear will be much smaller.
So a debt buyback is a kind of quandary: to achieve a haircut, the fear of default must be exploited, which is ultimately alleviated.
Without the Ecuador tricks, it does not look as if buybacks could make a significant contribution to resolving the Greek debt crisis.
An Arab Marshall Plan
OXFORD - The uprisings in the Arab world two years ago grew out of demands for freedom, bread and social justice.
But, while revolutions toppled dictators and transformed societies, these core demands are as far from being met as ever.
The economic challenges facing the Arab Spring countries have become even more pressing, weighing heavily on their political futures.
Unemployment has almost doubled in Tunisia and Egypt, while foreign direct investment has declined throughout the Arab world.
Tourism revenues, while robust, are also declining, and budgetary challenges are still significant.
But the economic urgency is not reflected in the policy response, which is painfully slow or absent.
Egypt's budget deficit, for example, will exceed 11% of gross domestic product this year.
But the country's policymakers could not agree on the terms of a much-needed loan from the International Monetary Fund.
The government cut fuel subsidies last year without any additional reforms, and the necessary tax increase was postponed shortly after President Mohammed Morsi announced it.
Almost all political stakeholders in Egypt and the other Arab countries in a process of change know that economic reform is necessary.
But neither citizens nor politicians seem willing to bear the social and political costs of such a reform.
In a charged and uncertain political climate, in which new crises erupt every day, it is not surprising that economic reform has been repeatedly postponed.
Politicians know that macroeconomic stabilisation and social cohesion cannot be combined in the short term.
Cutting food and energy subsidies to reduce household burdens has little chance of gaining support in a country like Egypt, where 40% of per capita income is spent on food.
Policymakers are therefore reining in efforts to strengthen public finances.
At the same time, strict IMF guidelines threaten to exacerbate political instability, with citizens no longer afraid to take to the streets to vent their displeasure.
But the current stalemate over economic reform underscores a broader point: subsidies and tax systems cannot be reformed without first redefining the underlying social contract, which swapped long benefits for political tolerance.
But, at a time of economic uncertainty and high unemployment, such a move is far too risky for a single politician, or perhaps even a single country.
To create the political space needed for economic reform, Arab leaders must forge a regional growth pact - something akin to a Marshall Plan - that will allow for large new investments and revive economic activity.
It is much easier to reform subsidy programs when the economy is growing.
Furthermore, it is essential to build a competitive market if sustainable growth in gross domestic product is to be ensured.
This will require the removal of regional trade barriers, which are even more widespread in the Arab world than in Sub-Saharan Africa.
By agreeing on a pact, Arab countries could commit to reforming their subsidy systems and reducing restrictions on cross-border trade.
The regional dimension of prosperity has been ignored in the Arab world for too long.
But weak regional links limit the growth potential of small firms, forcing them to rely on government services.
While Arab leaders often portray Turkey as a beacon of hope, they seldom acknowledge that the country's recent transformation from the sick man of Europe to one of the world's fastest-growing emerging economies would not have been possible had it not taken advantage of regional synergies.
Such links are particularly important for Egypt and Tunisia, which will struggle to reduce unemployment unless the Libyan labour market, which has always welcomed migrants from neighbouring North African countries, is reopened.
And, while Tunisia's situation appears to be the most promising, a crushing investment backlog threatens the success of reforms there.
With Europe still in crisis, Tunisia can only hope for capital flows from its resource-rich Arab neighbors.
Arab countries must also increase their development spending.
Given that existing development banks in the region have largely failed to act as vehicles of coordination and commitment, a new institution would need to be created, similar to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to coordinate regional development projects and cover the costs of economic reform.
New investment vehicles, such as sovereign wealth funds and financing structures under Islamic law, can help finance firms that desperately need credit.
At the same time, Arab countries must make current aid projects more stringent.
Arab governments have for too long simply covered up problems with money, resulting in rich Gulf states effectively subsidizing their neighbors "public services.
Over the past two years, Saudi Arabia has provided more than $3 billion to Yemen.
Qatar has transferred $5 billion to Egypt since 2011, with the prospect of another $3 billion.
And the United Arab Emirates recently pledged $2.5 billion to Bahrain.
But unconditional aid only postpones reforms because it weakens fiscal constraints, thereby relieving pressure on politicians and creating a moral dilemma.
The Arab Spring has exposed fractures that run not only through individual countries, but also across the region.
It is therefore necessary to redefine relations not only between citizens and their states, but also between states themselves.
Above all, it is no longer wise to divide Arab countries into donor and recipient countries, or resource-rich and resource-poor countries.
It is in the interests of the entire region, including countries that are not imminent, that all countries contribute to the economic revival of their neighbors and support their political transformation processes.
A lesson in history for Koizumi
Protests are once again erupting in China and South Korea against Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's annual visit to the Yasukuni Shrine.
Koizumi's insistence on paying homage to the war dead buried in Yasukuni, including convicted World War II war criminals, has strained Japan's relations with its neighbors for years.
For example, Chinese President Hu Jintao continues to point out that there will be no summit with a Japanese prime minister visiting the Yasukuni Shrine, which most Chinese see as a glorification of Japan's past aggression and colonialism.
Even Japan is increasingly critical of Koizumi in some quarters.
Although Japanese public opinion is negative about China's outbursts of protest, a recent survey shows that more than 70% of Japanese view current Sino-Japanese relations as unacceptable.
Fewer and fewer people support Koizumi's annual pilgrimage to the Yasukuni Shrine. Seven former prime ministers unanimously demand that Koizumi refrain from such visits.
But Koizumi remains stubborn.
Moreover, Koizumi's most likely successor, government spokesman Shin Abe, has publicly said that he would maintain those visits to the shrine as prime minister.
Foreign Minister Taro Aso, another possible successor to Koizumi, asked the Japanese emperor to pray at the Yasukuni shrine.
It seems that pessimism is spreading and the stalemate on the Yasukuni issue is deepening.
However, the past is not the only source of difficulties of this kind. Even positive lessons can be learned from the Yasukuni issue.
Compare Koizumi to one of his predecessors, Yasuhiro Nakasone, who was prime minister of Japan in the 1980 "s.
Both are brilliant politicians who maintained their popularity and stayed in power for many years.
Both are conservative and nationalist, advocating constitutional change and a determined political and military presence of Japan in the world.
Nakasone said Japan was America's unsinkable aircraft carrier in East Asia, and Koizumi sent Japanese troops to Iraq to support the U.S.-led war coalition.
But one crucial difference between Nakasone and Koizumi is often overlooked: their handling of the Yasukuni conflict and relations with China.
Nakasone broke the taboo by becoming the first Japanese Prime Minister in official capacity to commemorate the dead at Yasukuni Shrine on August 15, 1985, the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II.
This event led to a massive reaction from China, where students demonstrated against the visit.
Bilateral relations have been frozen.
But, rather than capitalize on domestic resentment of China's criticism, Nakasone chose not to visit the shrine a second time.
He decided to repair relations with China by focusing on the positive aspects of bilateral ties.
In 1986, Nakasone visited Beijing at the personal invitation of the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Hu Yaobang, laying the foundations for a Sino-Japanese youth exchange center to foster future friendship with China.
These sincere efforts at reconciliation brought much-needed support to China's leaders, who were keen to control anti-Japanese sentiment.
Hu praised Nakasone's courage and publicly warned Chinese youth that they would not be level-headed patriots if they had only the welfare of their own country in mind.
Nakasone emerged from this crisis as a highly respected statesman who had succeeded in finding a diplomatic solution with China.
There was no suggestion that Nakasone had betrayed Japan.
Nor was his conservative, national, and pro-American reputation tarnished.
This story shows that Koizumi's hard line is not the only option.
A Japanese prime minister can show strength without exploiting domestic resentment of a neighbor; he can be conservative, patriotic, and pro-American, while still building healthy, functioning relations with China.
Indeed, abandoning visits to the Yasukuni Shrine could probably open the door to a long-overdue Sino-Japanese summit, which would in turn strengthen the moderate voices in China seeking forward-looking relations with Japan.
Unfortunately, Koizumi and his companions are not prepared to change their minds on the Yasukuni issue.
As the Foreign Secretary put it recently: "The more China expresses its rejection, the more one feels the desire to go there."
It's like a father trying to ban his child from smoking.
No one expects Japanese and Chinese leaders to embrace each other, as Nakasone and Hu did twenty years ago, but it is simply sad when the leaders of neighboring large countries pretend not to see each other at international meetings.
If Nakasone, who is now urging Koizumi to stop pilgrimages to Yasukuni, had to answer Aso, he would probably simply broaden the comparison: it is not in Japan's national interest to continue to be Koizumi's passive smoker.
A Human Rights Tribunal for Africa
One crucial lesson from one hundred years of experience with the creation of international tribunals and tribunals is that the impetus is vital, but it is just as important to get it right from the outset.
25 January 2004 was a milestone in the history of human rights protection in Africa: without much fanfare, the protocol establishing an African Court of Human and Civil Rights entered into force.
After Europe and the two Americas, Africa will become the third continent with a regional court that will enable action to be taken against human rights violations.
The adoption of the Protocol by such influential African states as Algeria, South Africa and Libya last year marked the final and decisive step towards the establishment of the Court. Shortly before the beginning of 2004, the Comoros signed the Protocol, thereby achieving the minimum number of fifteen ratifications.
However, particularly in countries such as Burundi, Côte d'Ivoire, Rwanda and Uganda, which have signed the Protocol without exception, the Court is likely to play a major role in verifying respect for human rights.
This is because the rulings of the Court of Justice are legally binding and therefore enforceable before national courts.
In the States that accept the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice, it will be possible for individuals to appeal directly to the Court of Justice and even to take legal action against their own governments.
It will be possible for African NGOs to consult the Court for Opinions, thereby strengthening the effectiveness of the African human rights system.
Of course, the birth of an African human rights court should be celebrated.
But you run the risk of failing right from the start if the foundation is not deliberate but hasty.
The process is proceeding at an astounding - and worrying - pace.
The first judges will be nominated at the end of April, with the aim of electing them at the African Union Summit in Addis Ababa between 5 and 7 July.
Experience shows that the whole system is finalised with the appointment of judges, the drafting and adoption of rules of procedure and relations with other international organisations.
This will also cement any mistakes and shortcomings in the initial phase.
However, the creation of a well-ordered international legal institution must not be rushed, requiring time and resources - both human and financial - and a great deal of support.
It took more than four years to establish the International Criminal Court, requiring massive efforts by the UN and some major countries, as well as hundreds of experts, NGOs, and think tanks.
Admittedly, sometimes time is a luxury.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) began their work in less than a year to address the heinous crimes that have just been committed.
The price of this urgent task, however, is clear: when the first cases were brought to court, statutes as well as procedural and evidence guidelines first had to be drafted in a fast-track procedure.
The Statutes of the ICTY have been revised four times and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence twenty-seven times.
The figures for the ICTR are only slightly better.
This is a very poor outcome for a court designed to ensure legal certainty and a fair trial for the accused.
This tinkering, however, was only possible because there was an extraordinary consensus in the UN Security Council that the procedures should not be delayed.
Such unity, however, is not commonplace.
In courts which, like the African Court of Justice, are created by treaty, it is likely to be very difficult, if not impossible, to find a majority for change.
Moreover, effective courts must be politically independent.
However, this can only be achieved if the right conditions are in place from the outset.
The nomination process for judges at national level is crucial in this respect.
Appropriate candidates - who are widely regarded as suitable - are the key to a court's legitimacy.
The European human rights system provides for the participation of civil society in the nomination process and strict scrutiny by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
The selection of the best candidates - who can guarantee the highest degree of independence - is only guaranteed through an open and transparent selection process.
However, this is time-consuming.
Furthermore, the body of judges of any international court is crucial, as it is responsible for the preparation and adoption of other key documents - such as the rules of procedure and internal and financial guidelines - which determine the Court's operation over a period of years.
African Heads of State would therefore be better advised, when they meet in Addis Ababa in July, to discuss the location of the Court, its funding and, above all, the standards that ensure an open, participatory and transparent selection process for its judges.
There should be no haste in nominating judges to a court that is largely still in the draft stage.
Africa is in the process of establishing its own human rights tribunal, fifty years after Europe, twenty-five years after the two Americas and two years after the creation of the International Criminal Court.
Above all, Africa needs a human rights court to which the governments and peoples of the continent pay full and undivided respect.
African leaders should take a few more months to accomplish this.
A crime against human rights in Gaza
Atlanta: The world is currently witnessing a terrible crime against human rights in Gaza, where one and a half million people are being held captive by sea, air or land with virtually no access to the outside world. An entire population is being brutally punished here.
The savage mistreatment of Palestinians in Gaza was dramatically exacerbated by Israel, with US support, after political candidates representing Hamas won a majority of seats in the Palestinian Authority's parliament in 2006.
All international observers agreed that the elections were honest and fair.
Israel and the United States refused to recognize the right of Palestinians to form a government of national unity composed of Hamas and Fatah, and Hamas now controls the Gaza Strip alone, after infighting. Forty-one of the 43 Hamas candidates who won elections in the West Bank have now been detained by Israel, along with another ten who held positions in the short-lived coalition cabinet.
Whichever side you are on in the partisan struggle between Fatah and Hamas within occupied Palestine, we must remember that economic sanctions and restrictions on the supply of water, food, electricity and fuel are causing extreme hardship among the innocent people of Gaza, some one million of whom are refugees.
Israeli bombs and rockets periodically strike the enclosed area, causing equally high casualties among militants and innocent women and children.
Even before last week's high-profile killing of a mother and her four young children, a report by Israel's leading human rights organization B-Tselem confirmed this pattern: 106 Palestinians were killed between February 27 and March 3.
Fifty-four of them were civilians not involved in the fighting and 25 were under the age of 18.
On a recent trip to the Middle East, I tried to gain a better understanding of the crisis.
One of my visits was to Sderot, a community of some 20,000 people in southern Israel, often hit by rudimentary rockets fired from nearby Gaza.
I condemned these attacks as despicable and as an act of terrorism, as most of the 13 victims have not been involved in fighting over the past seven years.
Subsequently, I met with Hamas leaders, both with a delegation from Gaza and with senior leaders in Damascus, Syria.
I made the same accusations to them, urging them to declare a unilateral ceasefire or agree a mutual agreement with Israel to cease all fighting in and around Gaza for an extended period.
Their response was that previous such measures had not been reciprocated, and they reminded me that Hamas had previously insisted on a ceasefire for all of Palestine, Gaza and the West Bank, which Israel had rejected.
Hamas then made a public proposal for a reciprocal ceasefire, limited to Gaza, which the Israelis considered and also rejected.
There are ardent arguments on both sides as to who is to blame for the lack of peace in the Holy Land.
Israel has occupied and colonized the Palestinian West Bank, which accounts for about a quarter (28.5%) of Israel's territory, as recognized by the international community.
Some Israeli religious groups claim land on both sides of the Jordan River, and others stress that Israel's 205 settlements, with some 500,000 people, are necessary for security reasons.
All Arab states have declared their readiness to fully recognize Israel if it complies with key UN resolutions.
Hamas has said that it will recognize any peace treaty negotiated between Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, provided that it is approved by the Palestinian people in a referendum.
This promises progress, but despite the short-lived fuss and positive declarations at the peace conference last November in Annapolis, Maryland, there has been a backward step in the peace process.
Nine thousand new Israeli housing units have been announced for settlements in Palestine, the number of roadblocks in the West Bank has increased, and the stranglehold over Gaza has been tightened.
It is one thing for other leaders to put the US first in crucial peace negotiations, but the world cannot stand idly by while innocent people are subjected to atrocities.
It is time for strong voices in Europe, the United States, Israel and elsewhere to stand up and condemn this human rights tragedy among the Palestinian people.
One hundred years of superconductivity
CHICAGO - The world's first quantum computer, a device that harnesses the magic of quantum phenomena for memory and processor purposes, has been sold to Lockheed-Martin by Canadian firm D-Wave Systems at an incredible rate faster than today's silicon-based computer chips.
In response to widespread skepticism about whether it is really a quantum computer, its developers have published articles in scientific journals that show that the basic components of this novel computer are indeed superconducting quantum bits.
This spring marked the centenary of the discovery of superconductivity - the ability of materials to conduct electricity without loss.
Electricity in superconducting wires can flow there for years without measurable dissipation.
Due to this property, superconductors possess unique capabilities that can be used in a variety of ways.
They can conduct enormous amounts of electricity, making them ideal for urban high-voltage grids.
And wound as coils, they can generate extremely strong magnetic fields.
Such superconducting magnets are already used in many technical areas.
The best-known examples of this are the magnets that drive magnetic resonance imaging in hospitals.
Perhaps most exotic are the giant magnets used to accelerate particles in the Large Hadron Collider, which tracks the fundamental principles of matter.
Despite their promising properties, superconductors also have limitations, one of which is that most require very low temperatures near absolute zero (-273 ° C) for their conductivity.
Such temperatures can only be produced by cooling with liquid helium.
This is why researchers from Switzerland caused a stir in 1986 when they discovered the superconductivity of a copper oxide that works at twice the temperature of the previous record holder.
Shortly thereafter, scientists in the USA discovered a similar material that has superconductivity above the temperature at which air liquefies.
As Time magazine wrote in 1987, the discovery of these so-called cuprates started the superconductor revolution.
But the revolution soon fizzled out.
Working with cuprates is extremely difficult as they are very fragile.
This is reinforced by their high anisotropy, as the materials have a quasi-two-dimensional structure consisting of a weakly bonded stack of conductive layers.
This makes them a real challenge for industry, although they are gradually being used in applications.
Since the first appearance of cuprates, several other high-temperature superconductors have been discovered, one a simple composite of magnesium and boron, another an iron-arsenic alloy.
Although none of them conduct air above the liquefaction temperature, they may be easier to process.
Given the enormous number of possible composites of elements, there is a good chance that we could discover even better superconductors.
Superconductors are expected to play a growing role in technology in the coming years.
Already, second-generation cuprates are being used to produce high-power cables to transport electricity and lighter generators for wind turbines.
Stronger superconducting magnets lead to the development of tomographs with better diagnostic capabilities.
Superconductors are used for high-speed trains in magnetic levitation technology and as microwave filters in mobile radio transmission stations for improved signal bandwidth.
The discovery of a new superconductor with improved properties could lead to even greater technological progress.
This brings us to the intellectual challenge involved.
There were 46 years between the discovery of superconductivity and the theory of Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS) to explain the phenomenon in 1957.
During this time, many famous physicists tried and failed to explain it, including Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg and Richard Feynman.
To find a solution, it was necessary to develop advanced theoretical techniques.
It was difficult to find out what conditions made the electrons superconducting.
The fundamental discovery of BCS was that the electrons join together in pairs in superconductivity.
Fortunately, the workings of such a pairing were known.
Although electrons are negatively charged and therefore repel each other, the positive ions that form during the flow of electrons through a metal can cause an attraction between two electrons under certain conditions (e.g. very cold metal).
However, there is a suspicion that this is not the case with the new superconductors.
Cuprates develop their superconductivity at much higher temperatures, but more importantly, they have some strange properties: They are created by inserting electrical conductors into a base material that acts magnetically insulating, and this is the very last place you would look for a conventional superconductor.
And unlike the BCS theory, where the pairs are isotropic with identical properties in all spatial directions, the pairs in cuprates are strongly anisotropic and resemble a clover leaf.
How can electrons without connecting ions be brought together and thus produce superconductivity at higher temperatures?
There are many ideas, but to develop the means to solve such electron-electron theories, we need new theoretical breakthroughs, which may even include black holes.
Whatever such a theory ultimately looks like, it is certain to revolutionize physics.
A Japanese metamorphosis?
OSAKA The landslide victory of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) in last Sunday's parliamentary election put an end to a party-dominated system that had dominated the Liberal Democratic Party almost uninterrupted since 1955.
For most of the past decade, the DPJ was not seen as a viable alternative to the LDP, though both seemed to form a pseudo-two-party system.
Twenty years after the end of the Cold War, Japan will finally have a post-Cold War system of government.
Even now, the Japanese public remains uncertain about the DPJ's ability to govern, skeptical of its hopeful programs of wealth redistribution, which lack sound financing.
The public is also aware that the ideologically fragmented DPJ lacks a pragmatic and coherent foreign and security policy.
Nonetheless, the DPJ will form the next government, owing to general aversion to the LPD.
Over the past four years, the LDP has been completely deaf to the public's most important concerns: pensions, unemployment, and the increasingly patchy social safety net.
The LDP has also struggled with a series of minor scandals and constant bungling.
The consumption of three prime ministers in little more than a year made it clear that the party's centre of power had melted.
Once in office, the DPJ will have to confront the massive bureaucracy and deep-rooted high-ranking bureaucrats who typically sabotage any effort at administrative reform that threatens its power and interests.
Budget estimates for the next financial year are due immediately after the election.
The figures presented are the result of a lengthy process in which the bureaucracy consulted closely with the LDP.
So, in order not to interrupt the regular budgetary cycle, the DPJ will be forced not only to implement the supplementary budget designed by the LDP, but will also be bound to next year's budget prepared by the LDP, which quantifies the LDP's policies condemned by the DPJ.
As a result, the DPJ has now announced plans to repeal the LDP's policy of capping budget demands and submit its own budget, as well as to draft its own supplementary budget.
Time is short, however, and few DPJ members have the legislative experience and budgetary expertise to implement it.
To bring the bureaucrats under control, the DPJ plans to install 100 partisans at the top of ministries, as well as three dozen political appointees in the prime minister's office.
Unfortunately, the DPJ rejected an LDP-backed public-service reform bill that would have allowed the DPJ to replace bureaucrats with an army of political appointees.
Despite its manifesto, the DPJ seems unprepared to tame bureaucrats, and may therefore be forced to rely on them.
The rise of these high-ranking bureaucrats is a legacy of Japan's unique historical development, dating back to the dawn of modernity.
In contrast to Europe, the state developed in Japan before a strong civil society developed.
Indeed, the full reconstruction of society only began after the Meiji Restoration of 1868, which definitively shifted the balance of power in favor of the state.
As a result, bureaucrats survived World War II, as well as America's post-war occupation, relatively unscathed, and they will do whatever it takes to survive a DPJ government.
They will most likely succeed.
Indeed, the LDP's lawmakers and bureaucrats developed a working routine in which the bureaucrats worked on Cabinet-backed bills; the LDP's deputies examined the bills, and together finalized the work on the bills, which were then submitted to the Diet.
Since the LDP, latterly with a coalition partner, controlled parliament, the legislative process consisted simply of interaction between LDP lawmakers and the bureaucrats sitting at LDP headquarters.
Parliament played a purely formal role.
Under the LDP-dominated system of a dominant party, this extra-constitutional mechanism became an integral part of Japanese government policy.
There will be a head-on collision between the DPJ government and the bureaucrats, in part because the party will struggle to find sufficiently qualified decision-makers.
Bureaucrats have maintained their privileged position in this regard, in part because of the tax system that prevents the development of non-profit institutions, particularly think tanks, where independent political expertise could emerge.
Moreover, perhaps anticipating a change of power, bureaucrats have already pushed ahead with annual staff changes at the highest administrative positions in government departments.
And what about the LDP?
After the loss of power, it will also lose control over the redistribution of state resources.
Unable to serve its clientele, the disintegration is looming ominously, for the LDP has never been a party with a strong base, but has functioned as a power and redistribution machine, owing to a network of insiders in all industrial sectors, professional associations, and communities.
Only by recruiting new faces and restructuring on the basis of a solid ideological platform can the LDP make a comeback.
With the DPJ's base even weaker, bureaucrats will most likely use their standard method of divide and rule to push the party in the desired direction, and will be told to copy the LDP when it comes to using government money and contracts to serve its key constituencies, such as labor unions and other interest groups.
Still, the birth of the DPJ government may mark a turning point.
There is a major shift of power in <unk>'s favour.
If the DPJ succeeds in freeing itself from bureaucratic control by centralizing policy development as it intends, Japan can emerge as a more resilient democracy with a fully-fledged two-party system and a greater willingness to assume international leadership.
Recovery without jobs?
Cambridge, Mass.: Who will suffer the longest and hardest from the implosion of Wall Street and the ensuing global recession of 2008-2009?
Not the bankers and financiers who caused the catastrophe.
Some, like Bernard Madoff, will go to jail for fraud.
But while Madoff was just the tip of the iceberg of widespread financial misconduct, most financiers need not fear arrest, either because their behavior merely violated the law, or because financial misconduct, which is more subtle than outright fraud, is often hard to prove.
Some bank bosses will step down in disgrace, but with huge severance packages to sweeten their farewells, such as the $55 million golden parachute from Ken Lewis of Bank of America, or the £25 million pension payment Fred Godwin of Royal Bank of Scotland received.
But, with the boost provided by government bailouts, guarantees, and low interest rates, many banks have once again begun to pay huge bonuses to their top managers, while vigorously opposing reforms designed to rein in their risk and reward culture.
The big losers from the economic catastrophe are workers in the advanced industrial countries, who have allowed themselves to be hijacked by the laissez-faire flexibility of American-style capitalism.
Between 2007 and October 2009, almost eight million jobs were lost in the US, reducing the share of the working population from 63% to 58.5%.
The unemployment rate stood at more than 10% at the end of 2009; the average duration of unemployment is the longest since the Great Depression. Millions of people have had their working hours cut, and millions more have been too discouraged by the lack of jobs to seek work at all.
The advanced countries of Europe, Canada and Japan also experienced a significant decline in employment, which will continue for a long time to come.
Spain, where temporary contracts are widely accepted, has seen the biggest rise in unemployment because Spanish workers can be fired just as quickly as those in the United States.
Some countries, such as Germany, Sweden and South Korea, have hidden their unemployed by paying companies to keep them on the payroll.
This may work in the short term, but it is unsustainable in the long term.
From the 1980 "s to the middle of this decade, upswing employment trailed GDP.
The US enjoyed a recovery under President Bill Clinton that did not create new jobs until the dot.com boom in the second half of the 1990s, and employment did not grow during the recovery under George W. Bush in the wake of the 2001 downturn.
In the early 1990 "s, Sweden suffered a severe recession, triggered by a housing bubble and a banking crisis.
Its unemployment rate rose from 1.8% in 1990 to 9.6% in 1994, before bottoming out at 5% in 2001.
Sixteen years after the crisis, the unemployment rate stood at 6.2%, more than three times the 1990 rate.
Korea suffered not only from the Asian financial crisis in 1997, but also from the US and the International Monetary Fund's insistence that the country must raise interest rates and implement Washington-style reforms to get help.
Employment rebounded, but primarily through non-regulated employment with limited employer benefits, low wages and low job security.
Inequality in Korea has increased from a moderate level to the second highest level (behind the US) of all advanced OECD countries.
A weak labor market takes an enormous toll on economic and personal well-being.
Young people looking for a first job and experienced workers who lose their jobs in a weak labour market suffer lifelong economic losses.
Quality-of-life studies show that unemployment affects happiness as much as the loss of a family member.
It is hard to imagine that the US will return to full employment any time soon.
Between 1993 and 1998, millions of jobs were created there, boosting the employment rate by 5.4 percentage points.
If employment began to rise at the same pace from 2010 onwards, it would take until 2015 to return to pre-recession levels.
And a slow recovery in the US will delay a recovery in the rest of the advanced world and reduce employment there, too.
A long, painful period of high unemployment is exactly the opposite of what many experts believe the US economic model will ever produce.
Since the early 1990 "s, many analysts have considered America's low union penetration, redundancy, reduced labor-related legal protections, and high job turnover to be important factors in achieving a lower unemployment rate than in most EU countries.
Many OECD countries have embarked on various types of labor-market flexibility reforms in the hope of strengthening their economies along the lines of the US.
The view that flexibility is the central factor in employment is no longer tenable.
In its Employment Outlook 2009, the OECD takes a critical look at its preferred policy reforms, noting that they are insufficient to help countries adjust to a financial-system recession.
According to the OECD, there seems to be no strong reason to expect recent structural reforms to mean that OECD labour markets are now much less sensitive to severe economic downturns.
So the lesson of the recession is clear.
The weak point of capitalism is not the labour market, but the financial market.
At worst, labour market failure imposes modest inefficiencies on society, while capital market failure inflicts serious damage on society, with workers, not the perpetrators of financial catastrophe, suffering the most.
Moreover, globalization means that the failure of the US capital market spreads this misery around the world.
We owe it to the workers who have fallen victim to this recession to reorganise the financial economy so that it helps to enrich the real economy instead of just making the financiers rich.
This means changing the incentives and rules that govern the financial sector.
And, with other countries "economies and jobs at stake, we owe it to their citizens to pressure the US to undertake financial reforms worthy of the name.
France's Midsummer Night's Dream
PARIS - France's national holiday, Bastille Day, was glorious this year.
The military parade, which celebrated Mali's victory and the joint action of African and UN troops, had the perfection of a graceful yet muscular ballet.
The pre-fireworks classical concert that ended the day was something of a French version of the Proms in London, a mix of light classical music and pop songs.
The Eiffel Tower added its own magic to the evening.
Paris is still the capital of the world, in case anyone was in any doubt, or at least it seemed to be for a night.
The melancholy that gripped France many years ago was all but forgotten.
The celebration of the glorious past, mixed with English pop songs of the present, revealed a strengthening national self-confidence.
What did this beautiful moment mean?
Was he merely the product of a collective self-delusion, a sort of emotional Potemkin village encouraged, if not concocted, by the authorities to instil a little more self-confidence in France's depressed citizens?
Even if the positive emotions dissipate (which is likely), they were real and tangible.
The French were in a celebratory mood.
Of course, it may simply have been the weather, a horrible spring has finally turned into a glorious summer.
But it may also have been one of those natural turning points, a collective and spontaneous decision to say, "Enough with depression, life goes on." "We French may not be what we once were," he said, but we are still much more than many people think.
We have a great revolutionary past whose values are still universal: freedom, equality, fraternity, and an army that, as in Mali, continues to make a difference in the world.
There are two lessons to be learned from this collective form of escapism.
The first is that among the many layers of depression and mistrust in France, there is the potential for a new and collective awakening.
This, of course, would require a less cynical political elite, which puts the country's well-being above its own petty ambitions and divisions.
The second lesson is even more obvious, namely that reality cannot be changed simply by a public spectacle.
France is not Imperial Rome, where panem et circenses were enough.
It is a weakened democracy that is so deep in an economic and social crisis that it threatens to become an identity crisis.
The proof was provided by the third traditional event on Bastille Day, between the military parade in the morning and the music and fireworks in the evening: President François Hollande's address to the nation, in the form of an interview with two prominent journalists.
He, too, sought reassurance.
According to Hollande, the recovery has just begun, hope is approaching.
His tone and message have changed.
He was no longer the normal man of his campaign and previous tenure, instead trying to portray himself as a superhero like his predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy.
Of course, his performance was the least convincing of the day, owing to his personality and low public approval ratings.
Who can say for sure whether the upturn announced by Hollande is real and not wishful thinking?
The audience reacted with a mixture of incredulity and indifference to the messenger of the message.
The behaviour of friends, all French, listening to Hollande with me reminded me of another moment.
It was December 31, 1989, when I was in the Soviet Union, in a restaurant in the old town of Suzdal, and I heard the New Year's wishes of Mikhail Gorbachev.
I was moved: the man who embodied glasnost and perestroika, who had allowed the peaceful emancipation of most Eastern and Central European countries, spoke.
But I was the only one who listened to him.
The restaurant's guests, like my French friends now, didn't care.
Their president had become the background noise.
Has Hollande become a French Gorbachev in this sense?
For the Left and the Greens, he is almost a traitor.
They elected him a year ago not only because he was not Sarkozy, but because he embodied the true values of the left, even if his centrist moderation seemed a bad omen.
Center and even center-right voters are also disappointed by the president's lack of charisma, not to mention sheer incompetence.
After a year of Hollande, France is undergoing a fundamental political revolution.
During the first half-century of the Fifth Republic, political life was shaped by the traditional two-party system of left and right.
But a tendency toward a system of three equally strong parties is becoming increasingly evident: the left, the right, and the extreme right.
If France is to capitalize on the positive emotions of the national holiday, it needs responsible elites willing to confront unemployment and its causes (lack of competitiveness and a rigid labor market).
What Bastille Day revealed, albeit briefly and superficially, is that there is the potential to unify France, but that requires more than empty promises.
Kick-off for peace?
Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan's recent invitation to Turkish President Abdullah Gul to visit Yerevan to watch a football match together was historic.
This visit would have been remarkable at any time, given the two countries "long-standing strained relations.
But as it now takes place, a month after the alarming Russian-Georgian confrontation, it may offer a real glimmer of hope that tensions in the volatile Caucasus region can be resolved.
Of course, there are longstanding and difficult problems between Armenia and Turkey.
But now is the time for both countries to put the past to rest and take their common security interests into their own hands.
In the new context created by the war in Georgia, everyone is aware of the urgency with which Turkey should become a genuine bridge between the nations of the Caucasus.
This expectation is an inevitable consequence of Turkey's geographical location and history.
The country, symbolically situated between modernity and tradition, secularism and Islam, and democracy and tyranny, is indeed a physical bridge between East and West.
For the people of the Caucasus, Turkey is showing the way to Europe.
It is a member of NATO and borders the three Caucasus republics that participate in a NATO Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP).
It wants to join the European Union, which would bring the EU to one of our three borders, and we ourselves aspire to membership one day.
Indeed, Turkey has never missed an opportunity to present itself as a regional negotiator.
Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Turkey proposed the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.
When Armenia's attempt to broker a Middle East peace deal faltered this year, Turkey assumed the role of mediator in both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Syria-Israel conflict.
Now, in the immediate aftermath of the Russian-Georgian crisis, the Turkish authorities have once again taken the initiative and taken the lead in the Caucasus.
The world should fervently hope that Turkey's proposal for a platform for stability and cooperation in the Caucasus is more serious and lasting than similar efforts before.
But, in order to succeed, Turkey must make a determined effort to wrest a promise from all actors in the region that it will not use force to resolve its disputes.
If this promise is made and kept, conflicts in the region will be placed in a completely different, more tolerant context, which would represent a historic breakthrough for peace.
Why not take the idea of such an agreement a step further?
We, in this region, can and I think we should demand a neutral Caucasus, free from security blocs and hostile alliances.
After all, security alliances and guarantees merely create dividing lines, with their associated security problems.
Throughout history, our countries and peoples have lived under one roof far longer than we have been divided.
Today, we share the common dream of European integration, and it is within this broader framework that our conflicts should be resolved.
The visits of French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Georgia and Russia have proved that there is no substitute for Europe when it comes to the Caucasus.
Only Europe can play the role of honest negotiator in the atmosphere of mistrust and intolerance in the region.
In the end, however, we ourselves must be prepared to work towards a peaceful and cooperative region.
The Caucasus is too small for closed borders and explosive conflicts.
Although some of these tensions appear to be purely bilateral, the Georgian-Russian conflict shows that such a thing no longer exists in the globalized world, and certainly not in this intertwined region.
Genuine peace in the Caucasus basically requires two important strategic changes.
One is a lesson from history: Russia's strategic interests here cannot be ignored.
Believing otherwise and behaving differently would lead the region into chaos.
The other lesson is that Turkey and Armenia cannot remain adversaries forever.
We need to normalise our relations so that the Caucasus can become a functioning region.
Ironically, both Russia and the United States recognize that this is in their interest.
The Russians see normalized relations between Turkey and Armenia as a way to minimize Georgia's strategic role in the region.
The US sees an opening for Turkey as a way to reduce Armenia's real and imaginary dependence on Russia.
Beyond the emotional impact of President Gül's visit to Yerevan, a real improvement in Turkish-Armenian relations will require the opening of the two countries "closed border, the last closed border in Europe.
It would also be a start if the existing rail link between the two countries were repaired.
If this did not happen in the coming weeks and months, Turkey would have shown that the whole thing was just a show.
President Gul's visit marks a turning point in either the failure to make history or the beginning of a new era.
A sustainable poison
NEW YORK Next year marks the twentieth anniversary of the collapse of communism in Europe.
Liberated from the complexity of too much knowledge of the cruel past, the youth of Eastern Europe's post-communist generation do not seem interested in what their parents and grandparents went through.
Yet the recent revelation of the alleged complicity of the Czech writer Milan Kundera in Stalinism is only the latest news of the long half-life of a poisonous past.
Other examples spring to mind: the accusations against Lech Walesa of collaborating with the secret police; Romania's public controversies over Mircea Eide's fascist past; and attacks on the supposed Jewish monopoly on suffering, equating the Holocaust with the Soviet gulag.
Friedrich Nietzsche once said that if you look the devil in the eye for too long, you run the risk of becoming the devil yourself.
A Bolshevik anti-communism, similar in its dogmatism to communism itself, has again and again spread to parts of Eastern Europe.
In country after country, this Manichean way of thinking, with its simplifications and manipulations, has only been slightly reshaped to serve the new rulers.
Of course, opportunism was also involved.
When the Red Army occupied Romania in 1945, the Communist Party had only 1,000 members; in 1989 it had almost four million.
A day after Nicolae Ceausescu's execution, most of these people suddenly became angry anti-communists and victims of the system they had served for decades.
Remaining traces of totalitarian thinking can also be seen in the hostility toward former dissidents such as Adam Michnik and Václav Havel, who both argued that the new democracies should not exploit resentments or take revenge, as the totalitarian state once did, but instead reach a new national agreement to form and empower a genuine civil society.
The former generals of the secret police and members of the communist nomenclature, unreachable in their comfortable villas and retreats, must derive great pleasure from observing today's witch hunts and the manipulation of old files for immediate political purposes.
But Kundera's case seems different, if no less irritating.
In 1950, Kundera, then a 20-year-old communist, reportedly reported a man he had never met, a friend of his friend's girlfriend, to the criminal police as a spy from the West.
The man was later brutally interrogated in a former Gestapo torture facility and spent 14 years in prison.
Kundera's name appeared in the investigator's report, the authenticity of which was confirmed after a distinguished historian discovered it in a dusty Prague archive.
Publicity-averse Kundera, who emigrated to Paris in 1975, has told <unk> nothing happened and <unk> that Czechoslovakia's cruel secret police, who had a vested interest in silencing or exposing the famous dissident writer, never used the incident to blackmail or expose him.
Until more information becomes available, from both Kundera and the authorities, the case will not be solved without reasonable doubt.
But when something has happened, this case requires deeper reflection.
As far as we know, Kundera was never an informant before or after this incident, and we cannot ignore the fact that he later freed himself from the obligatory totalitarian happiness propagated by communism.
Indeed, his case also serves as a reminder that the early 1950s was the most brutal period of proletarian dictatorship in Eastern Europe, a time of great excitement and dread that poisoned the minds and souls of faithful believers, fierce opponents and apathetic spectators alike.
Moreover, Kundera's case is hardly unique.
In 2006, the German author and Nobel Prize winner Günter Grass revealed that he had been a member of the Waffen-SS as a teenager 60 years earlier.
Similarly, a few years earlier, the world was shocked to learn that the famous Italian writer Ignazio Silone had collaborated with the fascist police in his youth.
Everyday life under totalitarianism, whether communist or fascist, was generally based on a deep duplicity, the effects of which will be felt for a long time to come.
I do not agree with those who say that we should not be interested in the dark episodes in the life of a great writer.
Why not?
We should be interested not in persecution, but in a deeper understanding of a bloody, demagogic and tyrannical utopia, human weakness and vulnerability, and we could even see it as worthwhile proof of an artist's ability to overcome his past faults and continue to create invaluable works.
But is it justified to defend morally compromised artists and intellectuals on the basis of the merits of their work, while condemning ordinary people for often less serious acts?
An egregious example of this was how the followers of the Romanian philosopher Constantin Noica defended his support for the fascist Iron Guard and his subsequent collaboration with the Communists, while condemning even an ordinary cleaner for scrubbing the floors of secret police offices.
Shouldn't the cleaner's work to feed her family, her children and herself also be considered?
Life under totalitarianism was an extreme situation that requires us to apply special, differentiated rules to all prisoners of this martyrdom.
In order to understand this epoch, we must know and carefully assess the circumstances, which are often unclear and immeasurable, never simplifying a complex daily reality in the name of current political objectives.
At the very least, in order to forgive, we must know what we forgive.
In Eastern Europe today, young and old alike can benefit from this lesson.
Moses walked with his people through the desert for 40 years, until they freed themselves from the harmful slave mentality.
A League of Democracies?
LONDON - Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain is calling for the creation of a "League of Democracies."
This new international group would have significant military capabilities coming from both NATO and a new quadrilateral security partnership in the Pacific between Australia, India, Japan and the US.
Of course, neither Russia nor China would be invited to join this league. McCain also wants to exclude Russia from the G8.
The League is necessary, McCain said, because the US and its democratic partners must be able to act without the consent of the United Nations (i.e. Russia and China) on issues of central importance to the US, such as the fight against Islamic terror, humanitarian intervention, and the spread of freedom, democracy, and free markets.
In other words, the League's main purpose is to marginalize Russia and China on the international stage.
Perhaps the biggest criticism of McCain's plan is that it would precipitate a new Cold War between states known as democracies or autocracies.
This is not only dangerous, but also absurd.
Russia and China do not threaten the free world with a powerful ideology and massive weaponry, as they did during the Cold War.
Moreover, the world's democracies also disagree among themselves on how to deal with Islamic terrorism or the genocide in Darfur: in the end, it was France that led the opposition in the UN Security Council to the US invasion of Iraq.
Moreover, the US needs Russian and Chinese help on issues such as terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and climate change.
Stigmatising these two countries as pariahs will not bring them on board.
"China must learn to behave responsibly," McCain declared in breathtaking arrogance, "but the reality is that Russia, in particular, has cooperated with the United States in the war on terrorism."
In the end, the idea is unfeasible.
It is inconceivable that India and China would be part of such a construction.
So we would all save ourselves a lot of trouble if we buried McCain's brainchild as quickly as possible.
The idea behind the project, however, is a serious point of departure that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair made eloquently on many occasions: democracies do not fight each other, so if the whole world were democratic, there would be no more wars.
Presumably, McCain's League of Democracies is meant to bring Immanuel Kant's dream of perpetual peace closer to realization, by pressuring non-democratic countries to turn back, if necessary by force.
Apart from the bloody failure of efforts to bring democracy to fruition in Iraq and Afghanistan, is it true that democracies never fight each other?
A positive answer to this question seems to depend on two assertions.
The first is that it is a historical fact that democracies have never fought each other.
This is true of only a fairly small group of rich countries (India is partly an exception), especially countries in Western Europe and its overseas offshoots, in the post-World War II period.
They are also democracies along the lines of our own parliamentary democracies, with all the characteristics that we take for granted in modern Western systems - not Islamic democracies like Iran.
An acceptable general conclusion to draw from this rather small number of examples would be that prosperous parliamentary democracies tend to live in peace with each other.
The second assertion is that these countries live in peace precisely because they are democracies.
The question here is whether democracy has brought them peace and prosperity, or whether peace and prosperity have brought democracy?
Did Europe owe its peace since 1945 to democracy, or did the long period of peace since 1945 enable democracy to become the norm in Europe?
The world already has a peacekeeping institution.
The United Nations was created to enable states of different political stripes to live together.
UN members undertake not to use force except in self-defense or in the event of authorization by the UN Security Council.
The US is frustrated because it cannot impose its will at the UN.
But the UN exists to protect all states from lawless behavior, including that of the United States.
By implicitly bypassing the UN and dividing the world into two armed camps, the League of Democracies would increase the risk of war.
Likewise, the world already has a mechanism for spreading prosperity.
It's called trade.
In 1994, the World Trade Organization was established to liberalize trade under acceptable conditions.
The system is full of shortcomings that still need to be remedied, but we do not need a League of Democracies for that.
If trade relations are subjected to various embargoes, sanctions, democracy tests, environmental standards, and human rights, the League is likely to slow down the growth of trade and also reduce the chances of poorer non-democratic countries catching up with others.
The sole purpose of a League of Democracies seems to be to legitimize war in democracies to spread democracy.
That's the thrust of McCain's message.
The United States was built to serve, as McCain put it, "eternal and universal principles."
Their God-given task is to build lasting global peace based on freedom, security, prosperity and hope.
Fine words!
But if that's the purpose of the league and I don't see another <unk> then it's a danger to the peace.
Its proponents believe that long-term coexistence with non-democratic countries is impossible.
This is crazy and it is not true to the historical facts.
It is up to the converted countries of Western Europe, which generally share American values but have learned something about political patience, to rein in America's fantasy of reinventing the world in its image.
I am wholeheartedly in favour of the spread of Western-style democracy, but not at the cost of making the world more ready for war.
Peaceful coexistence between different political systems is an achievable goal, one with which all the world's major powers can identify.
Less is more: a strategy for Africa
REYKJAVIK <unk> If there was only one strategy African countries should implement to increase their economic growth and improve their macroeconomic stability, it would be to reduce as quickly as possible the number of currencies circulating on the continent.
This would probably boost trade, as happened in Europe with the introduction of the euro, and it could help contain inflation, which is always good for growth, by subjecting monetary policy to international discipline.
The African Union is currently aiming to merge all the continent's currencies into a single currency by 2028.
In the meantime, several regional monetary unions are being drafted, in addition to the two already existing monetary unions, one de jure and the other de facto.
The first and oldest of these unions is made up of the fourteen countries of the Central African Economic Community and the West African Economic Community, both of which use the CFA franc.
The second Union consists of Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland and now Zimbabwe, all of which use the South African Rand.
With the exception of Zimbabwe, a newer member, the 18 countries in the two existing monetary unions have, as intended, experienced lower inflation than much of the rest of Africa.
The example of Nigeria illustrates the reasons for this.
Before independence, Nigeria's legal tender was the British pound.
The Nigerian pound was introduced with the establishment of the Central Bank of Nigeria in 1959.
Back then, one Nigerian pound was the equivalent of one British pound.
The system remained in place until 1973, when Nigeria introduced a new currency, the naira.
The exchange rate remained unchanged: one naira was the equivalent of one British pound.
The naira was intended to strengthen the country's independence by allowing the central bank to conduct its own monetary policy.
It was also about national pride.
The idea behind the new system was that an independent and flexible monetary policy would serve the nation's interest better than a fixed exchange rate that tied the naira to the pound.
But the introduction of the naira quickly ended parity with the British pound.
Government spending outpaced federal revenue, despite soaring foreign exchange revenues from oil exports after 1970.
The federal government's budget deficits were financed by borrowing at home and abroad, and by printing money, leading to inflation and devaluation of the new currency.
Today, one British pound costs 220 naira, which means that the annual depreciation has averaged 15% since 1973.
The devaluation might be justified if Nigeria had managed, with the help of loose monetary policy, to narrow the gap between the living standards of ordinary Nigerians and those of the British people.
But that didn't happen.
In Nigeria, the purchasing power of national income per person is now 50% lower than it was in 1980.
Given this experience, Nigeria now plans to abolish the naira and join a monetary union with four or five other West African countries (Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and perhaps Liberia).
But this planned monetary union, which until recently was scheduled to start in 2009, has now been put on hold.
Why so?
Although Nigeria is by far the most populous country in the group (home to 155 million of the six countries "200 million people), the smallest countries seem to have no qualms about being captured by Nigeria, especially as the new West African Central Bank is to be housed in Accra, the capital of Ghana (24 million).
But others may fear that their sovereignty will be weakened if the new Central Bank of the West African Monetary Area assumes some of the policymaking responsibility from the national banks.
That, of course, is the main purpose of monetary union.
When the West African Monetary Zone is finally established, the number of currencies in Africa will be about half the number of countries.
And if the five-member East African Community (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda) reemerges as planned, the number of currencies will be reduced by another four.
The view that sovereign national currencies are the best way to promote economic and social growth by enabling an independent and flexible monetary policy - the vision of Nigeria's post-colonial rulers - is gradually falling by the wayside.
Efficiency dictates the use of fewer and larger currencies (and foreign investors, understandably wary of weak and volatile currencies, demand this).
Indeed, the success of the European Union and the euro has made a strong impression in Africa since its introduction in 1999.
Currencies are, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, like democracies: the best way to preserve their integrity is to share them.
A liquid Europe
BRUSSELS - Is the eurozone coming back from the brink?
This is possible because the new rulebook for resolving the ongoing sovereign-debt crisis appears to contain a key component that has been missing.
The absence of this component was a cause of this summer's unfolding financial crisis, which spread across small peripheral countries such as Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, and also attacked systemically important countries such as Italy and Spain.
The contagion began when investors realized that Europe's rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, was designed only to provide financial support to peripheral countries.
This fund does not have, and will not have, enough resources to finance the large-scale bond purchases needed to stabilize the debt markets of large economies such as Spain and Italy.
The EFSF has a maximum of €440 billion at its disposal (anything beyond that would jeopardize France's triple-A rating), while Italy and Spain together have more than €2 trillion in debt.
In early August, the eurozone periphery's debt crisis produced a domino effect, as financial markets did not want to wait for one country after another to be downgraded.
Instead, they anticipated the end result, or at least one possible scenario, namely the dissolution of the entire crisis-management structure.
Markets had recognized that the euro was in a quandary, with the EFSF's borrowing capacity limited, and the European Central Bank unwilling to buy the bonds of vulnerable sovereigns on a larger scale.
It later transpired that the ECB's line was not that hard, though it declared that it would stop intervening as soon as the new EFSF became operational.
And, given the EFSF's limited firepower, markets would have been without support.
More broadly, the problem is that the eurozone needs a liquidity guarantor for its fiscal authority.
In a normal economy with its own currency, financial authorities are never short of liquidity, because the government can always rely (at least potentially) on the support of its central bank.
By contrast, governments within the eurozone are always in a precarious position: they have only very long-term assets (their tax revenues), but their liabilities, namely public debt, which largely needs to be renewed annually, are short-term.
If investors refuse to finance these debts at all costs, even financially responsible governments will run into a liquidity crunch and become insolvent.
Banks, too, have short-term liabilities (deposits) and long-term assets, which they can only liquidate promptly at large losses.
Therefore, when a run on banks looms, all countries provide emergency liquidity, as happened globally during Lehman Brothers "failure in 2008, when confidence in the banking sector collapsed.
The eurozone, too, needs such a mechanism to counter a run on member countries "sovereign debt.
This requires that financial authorities have access to large liquidity reserves in an emergency.
These can only be provided by the ECB.
The good news is that a solution is slowly emerging in which the ECB could serve as collateral for the EFSF.
This can be achieved simply by registering the EFSF as a bank, which would allow it, like other banks, to rely on normal ECB financing.
The EFSF could then borrow from the ECB and buy up sovereign debt on a large scale, which in turn would serve as collateral.
In this way, a sensible division of labour could be achieved.
The EFSF would deal with member countries "financial crises.
For countries with solvency problems, an adjustment programme such as that for Greece, Ireland and Portugal would be appropriate.
But if large countries run into liquidity difficulties, the EFSF could rely on ECB support.
When investors know that a liquidity squeeze is no longer possible, speculative attacks on solvent sovereigns will cease.
When word spread that this solution was being discussed, at least behind closed doors, the panic in the financial markets subsided.
Now this solution must be officially implemented.
As always in Europe, change stands in the way of legal and political obstacles.
But even the most reluctant politicians recognize that the cost of inaction is too high.
The legal obstacles in the European Union treaties to potential monetary financing of the public sector can be overcome.
More serious is Germany's unwillingness to admit publicly that providing liquidity to the ECB in sovereign-debt crises is a crucial prerequisite for future financial stability.
Only the German government and the ECB can initiate this subtle but profound reform of the fundamental underpinning of the euro.
You cannot postpone this decision for long.
Loans and prayers
NEW YORK - The countries known collectively as the PIIGS - Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain - are burdened with ever-harder-to-sustain public and private debt, and interest rates in some of the hardest-hit countries - Portugal, Ireland and Greece - have soared to record highs in recent weeks, even after their loss of market access led to bailouts financed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
Spanish interest costs are also rising.
Greece is clearly insolvent.
Even with a draconian austerity package totaling 10% of GDP, its public debt would rise to 160% of GDP.
Portugal, where growth has been stagnant for a decade, is experiencing a slow-motion fiscal train wreck that will lead to public-sector insolvency.
And in Ireland and Spain, the transfer of the banking system's huge losses to the state balance sheets, on top of an already escalating sovereign debt, will ultimately result in sovereign default.
The official approach to solving these problems, Plan A, has so far been to pretend that these economies are suffering from a liquidity crunch rather than a solvency problem, and that the provision of rescue loans, combined with austerity and structural reforms, can restore debt sustainability and market access.
This approach of extending and pretending, or lending and praying, is bound to fail because, unfortunately, most of the options that indebted countries have used in the past to free themselves from excessive debt are not realistic.
For example, the PIIGS "proven solution of printing money and getting rid of their debts through inflation is not available because they are trapped in the eurozone's corset.
The only institution that can get the printing press going is the European Central Bank, which will never commit to monetising budget deficits.
Nor can we assume that high GDP growth will save these countries.
The debt burden of the PIIGS is so high that robust economic development is almost impossible.
Moreover, any economic growth that some of these countries may eventually experience depends on politically unpopular reforms that will only work in the long run, at the expense of even greater short-term pain.
In order to grow again, these countries must also restore competitiveness by causing their currencies to depreciate in real terms, thereby turning trade deficits into surpluses.
But a rising euro, driven even higher by a premature tightening of monetary policy by the ECB, implies a new real appreciation that further undermines competitiveness.
The German solution to this problem was to keep wage growth lower than productivity, thereby reducing unit labour costs, and it took more than a decade before it showed results.
Even if the PIIGS started this process today, their benefits would come too late to restore competitiveness and growth.
The last chance to cut costs, bring about a real devaluation and restore competitiveness through wage and price deflation is accompanied by a steadily deepening recession.
The real depreciation needed to restore external equilibrium would push up the real value of euro debt even further, making it even less sustainable.
Reducing private and public consumption to increase private savings and implementing austerity measures to reduce private and public debt are also not alternatives.
The private sector can spend less and save more, but this would entail immediate costs known as Keynes's austerity paradox: a decline in economic output and an increase in debt as a share of GDP.
Recent studies, including by the IMF, suggest that increasing taxes, cutting subsidies and reducing government spending, even on inefficient government spending, would stifle growth in the short term, exacerbating the underlying debt problem.
If the PIIGS cannot solve their problems through inflation, growth, currency devaluation, or austerity, Plan A will either fail or fail.
The only alternative is to move quickly to Plan B: an orderly restructuring and reduction of the debts of these governments, households, and banks.
This can be done in several ways.
One can carry out an orderly restructuring of the PIIGS "public debt without actually reducing the debt capital itself.
This means extending the maturity dates and lowering the interest rate on new debt to a much lower level than the current unsustainable market interest rates.
This solution limits the risk of contagion and the potential losses that financial institutions would have to absorb if the value of debt capital were reduced.
Policymakers should also consider innovations used in the 1980 "s and 1990" s to help debt-burdened developing countries.
For example, holders of government bonds could be encouraged to exchange their existing bonds for GDP-linked bonds, which provide for dividends tied to future economic growth.
Such instruments effectively turn creditors into shareholders in a country's economy, entitling them to a share of its future profits while temporarily reducing its debt burden.
Reducing the face value of mortgages and passing on the potential appreciation in value to creditor banks in the event of long-term house price rises is another way of converting mortgage debt into equity.
Bank bonds could also be reduced and converted into equity, which would both prevent a sizeable takeover of the banks and prevent socialization of banks "losses from causing a sovereign debt crisis.
Europe cannot afford to continue to spend vast sums on the problem and to pray that growth and time will bring salvation.
No one will rise from the sky like a deus ex machina to save the IMF or the EU.
The creditors and bondholders who lent the money in the first place must shoulder their share of the burden, for the sake of the PIIGS, the EU and their own finances.
Long March with China
BEIJING US Vice President Joe Biden's visit to China ended on an optimistic note.
He assured Chinese leaders that the US would take their debt seriously, despite the recent rating downgrade; he spoke enthusiastically about the two countries "interdependence; and he presented his granddaughter, who has been learning Chinese for several years, as a future bridge between the countries.
But behind all the smiles and toasts, there are still serious problems and perception gaps between the world's two great powers.
Firstly, there is an attitude problem.
For those who see China's rise in a negative light, the country is simply becoming more and more arrogant.
It shows toughness in its territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea; it takes possession of its neighbours in the South China Sea, including disputed islands; it presented its own stealth fighter during the visit of the US Secretary of Defense; it sends the first aircraft carriers to sea for experimental purposes, indicating that the establishment of military bases in the Indian Ocean is within the realm of possibility.
Even a confrontation between the Chinese and a visiting American basketball team is seen as evidence of China's aggressive behavior.
On the other hand, many Chinese believe the US suffers from the syndrome of being a superpower.
From the Chinese perspective, the US has a rather dysfunctional government, but still insists that its political and economic system is the best in the world, and that everyone should adopt it.
They are heavily indebted, but they cannot stop spending and borrowing.
The US no longer has a competitive manufacturing industry, but blames others for its huge trade deficit.
And for the Chinese, the world's only military superpower is pulling the trigger a little too easily when it comes to interfering in other countries "internal affairs.
And then there is the problem of trust.
China's critics argue that its claim to a peaceful rise is implausible in the face of the undemocratic one-party system.
This is accompanied by a zero-sum view of the world, in which any increase in China's share of the world economy is automatically at the expense of the US or other powers.
Any Chinese military movement is assumed to have expansive and aggressive intentions to counteract them.
All attempts by Western politicians to get involved are met with doubts and criticism of going to bed with dictators.
Likewise, betrayal is always at play for all Chinese who view the US intentions with suspicion.
To them, the US is a declining superpower that is relentlessly trying to prevent China's rise by all economic, military, and diplomatic means.
Mention of human rights and democracy is merely an excuse to demonise China.
Arms sales to Taiwan, Tibetan activism, and revolutions of all stripes are all supported by the US and other Western powers to weaken China.
Despite decades of close cooperation, with millions of Americans, Europeans, and Japanese visiting China each year, and a similar number of Chinese now touring the US and other developed countries, both sides are looking grim through a window.
Increased interdependence has not led to a better understanding of even some of the fundamental problems.
In a recent interview, China's deputy foreign minister, Fu Ying, expressed concern about the state of affairs, saying the most important question is whether China and the US are enemies.
Will there be war?
While Biden reiterated that the U.S. does not regard China as an enemy, he acknowledged that Fu's concerns are not unfounded, saying that the worst-case scenario is a misunderstanding that leads to an unintended conflict.
The key problem for China, its neighbors, the US, and the rest of the world is not how many new-generation aircraft carriers, missiles, submarines, and fighters China may produce and deploy in the coming years and decades.
It is more about how China intends to use its newfound economic and military strength to pursue its domestic and foreign policy goals, and how the world's leading powers can ensure that the two countries do not end up hurting each other accidentally or through misunderstanding.
There is no viable alternative to a positive, lasting and open exchange between China and the rest of the world if we are to meet these challenges successfully.
The Chinese economy will continue to grow, the Chinese military will continue to modernize, and the Chinese will continue to be united in their aspirations to become a great power.
A Cold War-style policy of confrontation and containment would face strong opposition in China, whose global importance, especially in the financial sector, cannot be ignored.
Only a patient, creative, and consistent policy of engagement will dampen fears on both sides.
China's rise is a fact; its enduring peacefulness must be a priority for China, its neighbors, the West, and especially the US.
A looming crisis in antidepressants
Widespread prescriptions for mood disorders have always been bad, dating back to the days of opioids and cocaine and up to bromides, sleeping pills and tranquilizers: they all proved to be highly addictive drugs.
But it was only after years of denial that doctors finally admitted that this was indeed the case.
Now antidepressants - household brand names around the world - are becoming a problem.
Prescriptions have tripled in the last decade, with England now prescribing as many antidepressants as Valium did at its peak around 1979.
It is now clear that today's antidepressants are not the miracle drugs they were touted as.
The sometimes unbearable withdrawal symptoms, which can make it difficult and dangerous to stop taking antidepressants, expose many users to even more serious and depressing side effects: significant weight gain, loss of libido and mood swings, to name just the most common complaints.
Suspicions that such problems exist - in particular, the tendency to depression and suicide caused by drug use - have been rumored for years, but scientific studies have only just begun.
The results of a major study commissioned by the UK Medicines Regulatory Authority in mid-2003 will soon be available.
They will no doubt be presented mainly as a recommendation to amend the warnings in the small print on the medicines' labels and instructions for taking them.
This may help, but it does not do justice to the real question: how could the supervisory authority have allowed such a problem to arise again after so much bitter experience, and why are they now allowing themselves to be examined?
On the Richter scale for drug catastrophes, on which Contergan occupies place 10, the impending crisis of antidepressants seems to fluctuate between place 7 and 11.
Time will tell where exactly, but the real point is this: the Contergan disaster of the 1950 "s and 1960" s occurred because there was no independent control over the risks of the drugs, while there was the crisis of antidepressants under the direction of a complicated, expensive, and global surveillance system.
The crux of the antidepressant crisis is not that these drugs have done so much harm, but that they have been allowed to do so when the precedents were so obvious.
Once this crisis is properly investigated, it will not so much open a can of pharmacological worms as raise the question of what a medicine is and should be.
This fundamental question seems all the more important as the Internet has been groaning for several years with hints of the coming crisis.
The explosion of the Internet has led to completely new ways of collecting, displaying, and communicating such information.
It broadened and deepened the understanding of the problems associated with antidepressants and gave patients a common voice like never before.
Previously, monitoring the risks of drugs relied on occasional reports from health experts about patients "adverse reactions to drugs.
However, the current crisis exposes the fundamental inadequacies of such reports to such an extent that the experiences of users with drugs cannot be credibly ignored.
United by the Internet, many thousands of patients from all over the world began to describe their experiences with antidepressants and the problems they faced in stopping them, and bore little resemblance to the warnings on the accompanying leaflets.
The impact of these case reports has been far-reaching: in 2003, a pharmaceutical company revised its estimate of the rate of withdrawal complaints from 0.2% in 2002 to 25% (though the manufacturer of a similar drug continues to claim that it is not "behavioral").
The antidepressant crisis offers, for the first time, stark evidence of the value of summarized user reports in understanding drug risks.
Certainly, such user reports are not "scientific," and most of them may seem naive, confusing, exaggerated, false, and / or simply too self-referential.
Yet, in this case, they offer more reliable evidence than what numerous controlled clinical trials report.
So what is at stake is not so much the value of patient reports, but the integrity of medical research and the state of science.
"How colourful is clinical medicine now?" asked an editorial in the British medical journal The Lancet in 2002; the answer was "very, very damaging."
The ambiguity surrounding the marketing of antidepressants underlines how corrupt the profession has become.
The unfolding crisis is expanding into questions of democracy and science, the relationship between risk and benefit, and the conflict between the demands of industry and health.
But one feature captures, more than any other, the underlying problem: the gaping gap between the words of the patients who speak and the terminology of the producers, professionals, and authorities who twist those words.
In the 1990 "s," depression "was formally redefined as a serotonin deficiency disorder and the scourge of millions of people - a convenient and seductive view, but a far-reaching simplification.
The term "drug addiction" has also been redefined with the intention of preventing the loss of personal autonomy in the therapeutic context.
The very concept of "discontinuity symptoms" - an Orwellian Newspeak creation for withdrawing into oneself - implied that antidepressants carried no risk of dependency.
On the contrary, their wishful thinking leads experts to cite "discontinuity symptoms" as evidence of the effectiveness of vital remedies.
Later, suicides were routinely attributed to "non-accidental overdoses," and the ambiguous term "emotional instability" became fashionable, though it could not distinguish between a drug-induced suicide attempt and a crying spasm.
In contrast, user reports about adverse reactions try to describe some real conditions in people rather than create impressions that suit the relevant circles involved.
In the long run, the antidepressant crisis may turn out to be a hidden blessing, but only if it produces the openness and intellectual honesty needed to ultimately hold the medical profession accountable to the people it purports to serve.
A man against the machine
WASHINGTON, DC - America's financial sector has shown renewed strength in recent months, at least political strength, by undermining most of the sensible proposals under consideration for banking reform.
If we are still making progress at all, it is thanks to the noble efforts of a small number of US senators.
Of particular note is the work of Senator Ted Kaufman, a Democrat from Delaware (yes, a pro-business state), who has worked tirelessly to fix the most egregious problems in the US financial sector.
Kaufman knows that successful reform requires three prerequisites: persuasive arguments, the ability to bring colleagues along, and plenty of luck in the form of events that shine a spotlight on specific problems at just the right time.
On two fronts, despite initially offering little hope of success, Kaufman has actually made significant strides.
Long before it became fashionable, Kaufman insisted that the US housing boom was fueled in part by fraudulent schemes pervading the entire complex of mortgage-backed derivatives that is virtually the heart of Wall Street.
This thesis is gaining momentum as major newspapers report on the widening investigation by the US government and the New York State Attorney General into the US financial sector's practices in the mortgage and related securities sector.
Together with Senators Patrick Leahy and Chuck Grassley, Kaufman worked last year to pass legislation that would provide timely resources to US law enforcement agencies working on recent financial fraud cases.
And, more recently, Kaufman has been relentless in his cross-examination of Goldman Sachs executives.
Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the subcommittee that heard her testimony, appeared to share Kaufman's view, and after a year-long investigation into Washington Mutual, Goldman and the extreme failure of the banking regulator and credit rating agencies, he was just as adamant.
Kaufman pulled off an even bigger coup with his warnings about the dangers of exploding high-frequency trading, which is poorly understood by America's main financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and carries systemic market risks.
After the 20-minute interruption of trading in New York on May 6, his concerns appear justified; the exchange has completely failed in its basic function: pricing between buyers and sellers.
We do not yet know what combination of black box computer programs and automated trading algorithms that interactively connect more than 50 market centers triggered this disaster.
But our lack of knowledge itself confirms how far our ability to regulate and supervise has fallen behind financial innovation.
Kaufman's approach, whose central feature was speeches before the Senate, seemed irrelevant or even old-fashioned to critics just a few weeks ago.
No major Wall Street figures confirmed his concerns, preferring instead to praise stock markets as a shining example of well-functioning technology.
Now people understand what he means.
Senator Mark Warner graciously conceded: 'The senator from Delaware warned early on that the massive investments that certain companies made to gain a split-second advantage in trading could fall back on all of us.'
The SEC used to be a large and powerful independent agency.
The last few decades have been tough for them, and it is only now, under new leadership, that they are starting to turn the corner.
However, it does not routinely collect the data it needs (trading by time and customer) to understand the actions and influence of large traders.
Kaufman has repeatedly urged them to do more, and much faster; surely they and many others are listening now.
On a third point, the results so far have been mixed.
Kaufman has advocated downsizing America's largest banks as part of a broader financial reform effort.
His effort helped win more support and force a vote in the Senate on an amendment he introduced with Sen. Sherrod Brown that would have imposed a fixed cap on the size of banks and their leverage.
The amendment was appropriate and perfectly reasonable, but it failed by 33 votes to 61, also on 6 May.
Just days later, he might have received more support after senators witnessed giant eurozone banks being bailed out.
After all, he has bolstered support for another amendment, introduced by Senators Jeff Merkley and Carl Levin, that would restrict proprietary trading by megabanks at their own expense, a practice that is believed to be a large and dark part of high-frequency trading.
The deeper and overriding purpose of Kaufman's critique of our system is the need for strict laws.
We cannot simply rely on regulators to do the right thing.
In particular, regulators have no chance of being proactive and preemptive when markets are opaque and powerful Wall Street interests (and their Capitol Hill allies) hide behind the claim that there is no problem.
Unfortunately, despite his new prominence on the national stage, Kaufman will step down at the end of this year, after he was named as Vice President Joe Biden's successor in late 2008 and pledged not to run for re-election.
If he goes, dangerous elements on Wall Street will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief.
Let us hope that, by then, he has been able to help permanently shift the consensus among his colleagues, thus paving the way for further action by Congress aimed at a serious tightening of financial-sector safeguards.
Kaufman's enduring legacy will be a simple and plausible thought that sensible people increasingly see as self-evident: relying on deregulation and vested interests in today's complex and opaque markets does not appear to lead to a rational distribution of capital, or promote entrepreneurship and growth.
We need to write and enforce laws that restore the credibility of our financial markets.
Diagnostic mania in bipolar disorder
PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island - In recent years, many experts have argued that bipolar disorder is a serious illness that leads to significant psychosocial morbidity and excessive mortality, especially in patients with severe depression.
Even patients with diagnosed bipolar disorder often wait more than ten years for this diagnosis.
Clinical effects of undiagnosed bipolar disorder in depressed patients include undersupply of mood-stabilizing drugs and an increased risk of rapidly sequential cycles of fluctuations between manic and depressive phases.
Perhaps as a result of concerted efforts to improve diagnosis of bipolar disorder, in recent years we have seen the opposite phenomenon - over-diagnosis.
In my own practice, my colleagues and I deal with patients who report that they have already been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, despite the absence of manic or hypomanic episodes.
Of course, there are also patients who want to have their depression treated, but who actually suffer from bipolar disorder.
Yet overdiagnosis seemed to be more common than under-diagnosis.
For this reason, we conducted a study to empirically examine how often bipolar disorder might be under- or over-diagnosed.
Seven hundred outpatient psychiatric patients were interviewed according to DSM-IV (SCID) using the structured clinical interview. Subsequently, the study participants had to fill out a questionnaire asking whether doctors had previously diagnosed them with bipolar or manic-depressive disorder.
Information about the next of kin of the patients was also collected.
Just over 20 percent of our sample (145 study participants) reported that they had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder before, significantly higher than the 12.9 percent reported based on the SCID.
Less than half of those who reported having previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder actually had bipolar disorder based on the SCID.
Patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder based on SCID had a significantly higher risk of bipolar disorder in their family than patients who reported an earlier diagnosis of bipolar disorder in the self-completed questionnaire, which was not subsequently confirmed by SCID.
These patients had no significantly higher risk of developing bipolar disorder than patients who were not diagnosed with bipolar disorder either by self-reporting or by SCID.
Our results, validated by family information, therefore indicate an overdiagnosis of bipolar disorder.
For every study that tries to prove that a psychiatric disorder is over-diagnosed, it turns out that there are some patients who have been diagnosed, but a second survey reveals that they are not suffering from the disease.
This is simply due to the imperfect reliability of psychiatric diagnosis.
However, the question is not whether some patients with an earlier diagnosis are now no longer classified as ill on the basis of a second survey, but rather how many there are.
Determining the percentage at which an overdiagnosis is detected is a difficult problem to solve and a value judgment.
However, we believe that an overdiagnosis of more than 50 percent exceeds the clinical significance threshold.
There are costs associated with overdiagnosis of bipolar disorder.
Mood stabilizers are the remedy of choice in therapy, and depending on the drug, they can potentially lead to significant complications of kidney function, endocrine system, liver function, immune system, and metabolism.
Over-diagnosis of bipolar disorder may expose patients to unnecessary and serious side effects.
Marketing strategies and advertising by pharmaceutical companies may also play a role in diagnosing bipolar disorder too often.
Direct advertising is used to refer potential patients to screening questionnaires, which can lead to patients telling their doctors before an examination that they have bipolar disorder.
We have also observed this in our practice.
However, this development does not necessarily indicate a problem with the results of the screening questionnaire, but rather indicates how this tool is being used.
Screening questionnaires maximise sensitivity and lead to false positive results because it is assumed that this survey is followed by a clinical assessment by a specialist.
However, insufficient diagnostic thoroughness can lead to overdiagnosis.
Doctors are more likely to diagnose the disorders they feel safe treating.
We believe that the increased availability of approved medicines for the treatment of bipolar disorder may affect physicians to the extent that, in the event of uncertainty as to whether or not a person is suffering from bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder, they are more likely to identify the disorder that responds to medication.
This tendency is reinforced by the marketing activities of pharmaceutical companies towards doctors. Research on delayed diagnoses or non-recognition of bipolar disorder has been put in the foreground and thus sensitised the medical profession.
This campaign may have led to some anxious, restless and / or irritable patients with depression complaining of insomnia and raging thoughts being wrongly diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
The results of our study are in line with previous studies that have highlighted possible problems in diagnosing bipolar disorder.
Given the number of medicines authorised to treat bipolar disorder and the numerous reports in which doctors have drawn attention to the problem of not detecting the disease, overdiagnosis seems to have become a greater problem than under-diagnosis.
A Marshall Plan for the Arab World
ROME - US President Barack Obama's major speech on the consequences of the Arab Spring poses a challenge to Europe as well.
Only if the transatlantic partnership proves effective, as it did when it came to meeting the demands of the Cold War and overcoming Europe's division, can the West help to make the hopes raised by the Arab uprisings a reality.
The crisis in Europe's southern neighbourhood reflects a profound process of change that will have lasting consequences for the region, Europe and the world as a whole.
The Mediterranean region is central to Europe's peace, stability and economic growth.
Our Mediterranean neighbours outside Europe regard Europe as their natural partner.
And what happens in those countries, including the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, has a broad impact, which of course requires the close involvement of global partners, first and foremost the United States.
Recent events not only in Libya, but also in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, and Bahrain reflect the political complexity of these countries.
They are also the result of various factors, such as frustration with rising food prices and widespread corruption, along with demands for greater democratization, reduction of economic and social inequality, and job creation.
Europe's response to this process must be based on the goal of orderly and rapid change.
Proposals for a partnership for change based on political reform and full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms should bear in mind that the political landscape in the region is certain to remain tense and unpredictable in the coming months.
Not surprisingly, therefore, regional stability is a high priority for Europeans.
Chaos, a resurgence of terrorism, the rise of radical Islamism and massive waves of immigration towards Europe are just some of the potential threats to the European Union being considered.
Against this background, the EU should do its utmost to prevent any deterioration in the security situation within the region.
After 1945, a package of financial assistance, the Marshall Plan, aimed to rebuild and revitalize Western Europe's economies to support democratic change and political stability. Today, the Arab Spring countries face similar challenges and imperatives.
We need to enable countries like Egypt and Tunisia, and possibly a peaceful Libya, to strengthen their political stability through democratisation.
The Marshall Plan was accompanied by reconstruction partnerships in which the US and European recipient countries were on an equal footing.
The aim was to strengthen mutual cooperation in order to establish lasting peace.
In the Mediterranean, the situation is more advanced: the broad lines of partnership already exist; what is needed now is to strengthen Europe's integration with its southern neighbours.
That is why Italy has proposed a new EU-Mediterranean plan aimed at supporting the process of change and providing additional resources to the region, building on existing institutional and financial resources.
The Union for the Mediterranean, launched by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, must be revitalised and reoriented towards development projects ranging from expressways and ports to the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
At the same time, however, a broader economic initiative is needed to mobilize a critical mass of European and international financial resources to attract investment to the region and modernize its infrastructure and services.
Together with the United States, we should break down the trade and economic barriers that stifle these economies.
And we should grant some Mediterranean countries association status, allowing them gradual integration with the EU's internal market and participation in EU programmes.
Achieving all this will require a set of clear principles.
We Europeans must promote stability, create a genuine spirit of shared competence and promote political responsibility.In this new framework, the EU should avoid excessive conditionality, especially in the phase of change.
Europe's strong support for the region's economic development must remain a top priority as Arab countries embark on the necessary reforms.
In addition, a special financial organisation should be set up to help with this task.
One proposal worth considering is upgrading and strengthening the European Investment Bank's FEMIP (Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership), which would become an autonomous entity based in the Middle East or North Africa whose shares would be held by the governments (or other institutions) of the region and other interested parties.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London could join this effort by extending its activities to the region, coupled with the development of specialised services to support job-creating businesses.
The EBRD has made an important contribution to the process of economic change in Eastern Europe, and there is a strong case for using its experience and expertise to help the southern Mediterranean.
At the same time, the EU must launch a dialogue of equals on policy and security issues aimed at building trust across the region.
A Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean and Middle East (CSCE) could quickly become a useful tool for promoting this comprehensive approach to security and development.
In short, we need to transform the Mediterranean countries into producers rather than consumers of regional stability.
We Europeans cannot afford to abandon our Arab friends on the other shores of our common sea.
They are part of our common history, and they deserve the better future that we can help them to build.
A Middle East Union?
TOLEDO - This fall, the Toledo International Centre for Peace hosted a conference on water cooperation in the Middle East.
One conclusion of the conference was that any effective response to the unequal distribution of natural resources in the region must be regional.
With that idea in mind, Munther Haddadin, Jordan's former water resources minister, proposed a Middle East Water and Energy Union as a long-term mechanism for integrating a fragmented region.
The idea is convincing.
Addressing such basic needs in a way that manages scarcity and surplus regionally follows a compelling logic.
Indeed, the parallels with the role of coal and steel in forging the European Union are so clear that last month former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer called for such a union.
So did former Czech President Václav Havel and a group of global intellectuals who advocated the idea of regional integration through water.
Following on from the conference we held in Spain, we too are very much in favour of this worthwhile objective.
Of course, the European Union only became possible after Europe's central political disputes were settled.
And a successful process of regional integration in the Middle East will also require a political framework that ensures the stability needed for regional cooperation.
All sides need to know where their borders begin and end, and put past wrongs behind them, lest the cycle of revenge and automatic reflex in favor of short-term gains undermine regional solutions to the problems ahead.
At this point, it is worth noting the experience of a previous regional effort.
During the 1990 "s, the multilateral track of the Middle East peace process sought regional coordination on economic development, environmental protection, refugee issues, arms limitation, and water.
It failed when, in the face of despair at the failure of politics and the bloody reality of the second Intifada, the willingness to cooperate on a regional level waned as bilateral talks ceased.
The necessary political framework must also be regional in nature, and fortunately such a framework already exists.
The Arab Peace Initiative, first proposed at the 2002 Arab League Summit in Beirut and endorsed in Riyadh in 2007, provides a framework for all parties to resolve their differences and a political basis for moving forward.
Its adoption is essential in order to make progress, especially if it is complemented by additional chapters on regional security and economic relations.
Despite today's chronic pessimism, the pursuit of a Middle East Water and Energy Union, coupled with the Arab Peace Initiative, would change people's attitudes.
Together, the two would form a mutually reinforcing process: a political agreement would provide the framework within which the region's water and energy needs can be met; and effective and innovative delivery of these basic needs would make the Arab Peace Initiative an agreement that is more than just paper.
The low-water triangle formed by Israel, Palestine and Jordan will also be unable to meet its water needs unless an additional dimension is incorporated into the solution.
A World Bank report notes that the water needs of the 19 million people who will live between Jordan and the Mediterranean in 2020 cannot be met without increasing the cost recovery of existing desalination technologies.
As luck would have it, there were early signs last month of increased interest in a regional approach.
Bahrain's foreign minister recently called for a regional forum that would include Israel to solve the underlying problems; a former Saudi government official met with Israelis in the UK to reiterate the need for a comprehensive peace treaty; and Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud Barak said that it may be time to seek a region-wide peace deal accompanied by an economic package, as separate negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians may prove fruitless.
Despite decades of effort, the process of trial and error through bilateral approaches and strategies to conflict management has always ended in frustration.
No matter what economic projects were initiated, they crumbled in the face of the continued existence of the occupation.
The problems are too complex and the dangers posed by radicalism too pronounced for success to be built on good luck.
The Middle East can only overcome its permanent crisis by establishing a comprehensive basis for peace.
The Arab Peace Initiative, coupled with the long-term development of a Water and Energy Union, provides the necessary basis to meet the needs of the peoples of the region and mitigate future conflicts.
The Middle East must no longer be a symbol of irreconcilable violence.
It can stand for innovation in matters of general human importance - water, energy and politics.
A mispriced euro?
CAMBRIDGE - The European Central Bank (ECB), hit by rising inflation caused by oil prices and a surge in the dollar, has raised interest rates another notch.
There is more to come.
Growth is wonderful, inflation is terrible, and a central bank cannot help but choose: it must restore price stability even if it means sacrificing growth.
This is at least imminent if there is no sudden relief from an upturn in the euro.
But is it realistic to expect a recovery from a currency that has been under siege since its birth?
When it was launched, the euro reached impressive heights, like a high-tech IPO.
But the IPO soon went down miserably.
Since its launch, the euro has fallen even further from its peak than the Nasdaq did in the high-tech sell-off a few months ago.
As with the high-tech high-flyers of the Nasdaq, so with the euro, these nagging questions arise: What is the fundamental value?
Is there a fundamental mispricing of the euro against other currencies (especially the dollar), and how long is this likely to continue?
It is widely believed (though no one is betting much) that the Nasdaq is in danger of slipping further, while the euro will sooner or later have to return to normal, whatever that means.
Could the opposite happen?
A recent IMF study reports equilibrium and exchange rates based on long-term factor models in currency valuations.
The equilibrium rates are shown in the table attached; these are the current exchange rates.
According to these theoretical equilibrium rates of the IMF, the euro is considerably undervalued, 30% against the dollar and 18% against the yen!
I'm not sure that's the case.
Current IMF equilibrium rate
Dollars / Euro ($/ €) 0,88 1,26
Yen / Euro (¥/ €) 93.1 113.3
I'm not sure that's the case.
In assessing whether these theoretical values indicate a significant revaluation of the euro, let us look at how these values are achieved.
First, and most importantly, these equilibriums are based on a theoretical model in which long-term current-account balances tend toward zero.
Under this scenario, any country with sustainable voluminous current accounts must expect a hard landing and a correction in the valuation of its currency.
No country can live on borrowed money all the time, at least not at very high interest rates.
But are current-account constraints applicable in major and financially stable countries?
Canada has had current account deficits for 50 years, with the exception of three, and the US for 30.
As long as a borrowing country is stable and attractive, the market will not force a significant shift due to the current account deficit.
So it is in America: despite a gaping trade deficit, much investment is being made, financed by the rest of the world; public finances are huge and inflation insignificant; the new economy outlook is unabated; asset markets are showing that even if there is a US bubble, it is unlikely to burst with such a loud bang as it did in Japan a decade ago.
In such an environment, long-term equilibrium-rate models are pretty useless as a guide to short- or even medium-term exchange-rate developments.
The second limitation of long-term models is this: they are valued on the basis of historical events and do not take into account dramatic changes in the supply side or the financial environment.
Japan, for example, is struggling with a growth crisis and a public-finance disaster that is not exactly a common companion to a rising currency.
On the dollar-euro front, the US has embarked on a trend of unsurpassed high productivity, regardless of the current account; the upswing in American productivity (combined with financial stability) is the dominant feature; the current account is irrelevant.
The counterpart to this, because exchange rates are always determined by differential performance, is a consistently poor supply-side performance in Europe and Japan's persistent and prevalent economic misery.
There is a third reason why estimates of long-term current-account balances may have little predictive value.
Do Europe and Japan really want the US to achieve an external balance?
Europe and Japan, indeed the entire emerging economy, live off America's trade deficits.
These ensure that the world grows!
If there was a risk that the private sector would continue to finance these deficits, the ECB and the Bank of Japan would step in and buy up all the dollars that the private sector had kept away from each other.
There is a precedent for this: whenever the dollar weakens, foreign central banks are eager to help.
As John Connally, Nixon's treasury secretary 30 years ago, once said, "The dollar is our money and their problem."
The likelihood that exchange rates will soon come close to IMF values is low.
Yes, the euro can move towards parity with the dollar.
But it is also possible that the lack of support for the euro and the ongoing US miracle will cause the euro to fall to an exceptionally low level of $0.80 or even less.
For starters, investors will continue to think of the euro as a problem, as the ECB does.
The Euro IPO collapsed because it came at a time when the US economy was soaring.
The European product will already be up and running and will find its place in the sun.
But right now?
No chance to shine.
A more perfect monetary union
WARSAW - The eurozone is often seen as an experiment - a monetary union without political unity.
Those who see this in this way seem to be thinking of the model of a single state with two important features: limited fiscal sovereignty for regional and local governments, and a large common budget from which regions affected by asymmetric shocks can receive transfers.
Those who argue that political unity is necessary for the eurozone seem to be focusing on the second feature, even though financial constraints on local governments are clearly a typical and important aspect of individual states.
In this sense, you are ignoring the fact that the European Union's Stability and Growth Pact is, in principle, an important component of political unity, and not a substitute for it.
Indeed, the eurozone's current financial problems stem not from the lack of a large common budget, but from weak enforcement of the Pact.
Fundamentally, there were monetary units not only within individual states, but also in groups of sovereign states; the gold standard is the best-known example in history.
Two things can be learned from the experience of such monetary units.
First, member states need budgetary discipline that was below the gold standard with its informal norm of balanced budgets.
Secondly, there were no financial transfers from a common centre, as such a centre did not exist.
Instead, a high degree of flexibility, including within individual labor markets, enabled adjustment to asymmetric shocks.
It is clear that there is no scope for enlarging the EU budget in the foreseeable future in order to increase tax transfers to eurozone countries affected by a sharp drop in consumption.
This would require a stronger European identity, which the EU's political elites cannot artificially create. The crucial point, however, is not that a large common budget in the eurozone is politically impossible to achieve, but rather that it leaves the main problem unaddressed: the weakness of the mechanisms that protect fiscal discipline in member states.
Rather than looking at the wrong model - that of the individual state - the EU and its member states should focus on the conditions necessary for the smooth functioning of a monetary union in which there is no common budget to offset asymmetric shocks.
First, the first priority should be to strengthen the mechanism aimed at preventing pro-cyclical policies and large fiscal shocks.
This requires ensuring the credibility and transparency of accounting policies that define budget deficits and public debt, as well as greater monitoring of asset bubbles, which, when they burst, trigger deep recessions and thus a sharp increase in budget deficits.
Likewise, the European Central Bank's monetary policy should counter trends by paying more attention to asset bubbles.
Because the ECB's common monetary policy cannot be tailored to macroeconomic conditions in all member states, eurozone countries need macroprudential supervision aimed at reducing excessive credit growth.
However, the Stability and Growth Pact should be strictly enforced, which means that the sanctions available should be applied and strengthened.
To be sure, initiatives at the EU and / or euro area level cannot replace stronger disciplinary mechanisms in member states, which are ultimately the responsibility of national politicians and citizens.
But EU-wide discipline measures are needed to speed up the creation of preventive mechanisms in member states, and such initiatives depend largely on the big countries, which thus have a special responsibility for developments within the eurozone and within the EU.
Second, in addition to strengthening economic institutions, EU countries must accelerate structural reforms to improve their long-term growth prospects and enable smooth adjustment to shocks.
The former are needed to help EU members reduce their high public debt, while the latter would help them combat unemployment.
Many measures are needed in this area, the most important of which are vigorous efforts to complete the internal market and the prevention of economic nationalism at all costs.
The Lisbon agenda should also be revived, with a focus on market reforms, and the EU should urgently reconsider measures that could further strain its economy and / or hinder the flexibility of markets, in particular measures relating to climate policy and the trend towards an EU-wide social policy.
In this respect, it is extremely important how the budgetary reforms are implemented.
As EU members already have high tax burdens, further tax increases would weaken the forces of growth.
Budgetary reforms should therefore focus on reducing expenditure, which also requires an increase in the retirement age in view of the ageing EU population.
Finally, inflexible labor markets and regulations governing prices and supply-side reactions to the economy in general amplify recession responses to various shocks and contribute to rising unemployment.
Liberalisation of the labour market should therefore be a high priority and a further priority area for the revitalised Lisbon Agenda.
European elites like to make a fuss about European solidarity, social cohesion and the European social model.
But no amount of pompous pronouncements can replace, or even supersede, the reforms outlined here.
Complementing Brazilian soft power with hard power
BRASILIA For Brazil's citizens, it may be a truism that their country is, and always will be, a peaceful country.
After all, Brazil and its ten neighbors have lived without conflict for nearly 150 years and have negotiated their borders.
It last went to war in 1942, after a direct attack by Nazi submarines in the South Atlantic.
It has renounced nuclear weapons and signed a comprehensive nuclear control treaty with Argentina and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Through the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) and the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), Brazil contributes to the political, economic, social and cultural integration of the region.
But is soft power enough for one of the world's most important emerging economies?
To be sure, Brazil's peaceful foreign policy has served the country well so far.
Brazil has used its position to promote peace and cooperation in South America and beyond.
Its constructive attitude is based on a world view that places the highest priority on the values of democracy, social justice, economic development and environmental protection.
Brazil's distinctive approach to promoting these ideals is an important source of its soft power, reflected in the broad international support that has brought Brazilians to leadership positions in international organizations such as the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Trade Organization.
But no country can rely on soft power alone to defend its interests.
In an unpredictable world, where old threats are exacerbated by new challenges, politics cannot do without hard power.
Military power supports peace by deterring threats to national security. In Brazil's case, the country's hard power underscores its constructive role in the pursuit of global stability.
This role is more necessary than ever.
Over the past two decades, unilateral actions have undermined the authority of the UN Security Council in international matters of war and peace, creating more uncertainty and instability.
Similarly, little progress has been made on nuclear disarmament, in defiance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
In a security environment characterized by increasing competition for natural resources, the stakes for Brazil are increasing, owing to its abundance of energy, food, water, and biodiversity.
To meet the challenges of this complex reality, Brazil's peaceful foreign policy must be underpinned by a robust defense policy.
Brazil's National Defense Strategy, updated in 2012, states that modernization of the armed forces is intrinsically linked to national development.
It therefore stresses the need to strengthen the national defence industry.
In line with this strategy, Brazil is strengthening its conventional deterrence capabilities, including the construction of a nuclear-powered submarine, as part of a naval program consistent with its responsibilities in the South Atlantic.
Brazil coordinates closely with its neighbours on defence issues, both bilaterally and within the framework of the Unasur South American Defence Council, which aims to promote confidence-building, transparency, a common regional defence industry and, in particular, a common defence identity.
One potential mechanism for advancing these goals is a South American College of Defense currently under discussion.
South America is becoming a region where war is unthinkable, something political scientist Karl Deutsch would have called a "security community."
Having visited every South American country during my tenure as Defense Minister, I am convinced that the most effective deterrent is cooperation within the region.
At the same time, Brazil is stepping up bilateral defense cooperation with its African partners.
Brazil is working closely with its neighbors on both sides of the South Atlantic to strengthen the South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone (ZPCSA), which aims to keep the ocean free of rivalries and nuclear weapons.
Brazil is also reaching out to other emerging economies such as the other BRICS countries (BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and members of the IBSA Dialogue Forum (IBSA: India, Brazil and South Africa).
Brazil, together with South Africa and India, is conducting the so-called IBSAMAR exercises, regular trilateral naval exercises.
More generally, we are exploring opportunities for cooperation in the development of defence technologies.
Through these efforts, Brazil hopes to contribute to a more balanced and less hegemonic international order, without losing sight of the importance of mutually beneficial partnerships with developed countries.
Although Brazil supplements its soft power with hard power, it remains deeply committed to a path of dialogue, conflict prevention, and negotiated settlement of disputes.
The presence of Brazilian peacekeepers in countries such as Haiti and Lebanon underscores Brazil's contribution to global peace and security.
It also underscores Brazil's belief that a truly stable world order in the twenty-first century depends on a legitimate, effective UN Security Council that reflects the plurality of the emerging multipolar world.
China is growing back
HONG KONG For more than three decades, China's GDP has been growing at an average rate of more than 10% a year.
But former Premier Wen Jiabao accurately described this impressive growth momentum as "unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable," stressing the high economic, social and environmental costs that accompanied it.
Today, China must choose between the export- and investment-driven growth model of the past and a new, more appropriate economic order.
Cheap credit and perverse incentives, such as the promotions of officials who contributed the most to GDP growth, led to huge but redundant investments, which in turn contributed to overcapacity in manufacturing and infrastructure.
Not only is this model inefficient, but the use of government resources to support investment also undermines China's social development.
As a result, China's leaders have decided not to continue to use GDP growth as the main criterion for assessing public servants "performance.
Indeed, the twelfth five-year plan, which runs until 2015, envisages shifting China's economy to a new, more sustainable growth model based on quality and innovation, with annual economic growth likely to fall to 7% in the transitional period.
Most of today's discussions about growth models stem from the work of Nobel laureate Robert Solow.
For Solow, GDP growth is determined by the factor inputs of land, labor, and capital, as well as total factor productivity (CFP, or the change in output caused not by changes in resource consumption, but by factors such as technological innovation or institutional reform).
Since 1978, China has experienced three periods of high CFP growth, each lasting 5-7 years, through comprehensive reforms.
The first, in the early 1980 "s, followed the introduction of the rural system of household responsibility, which improved agricultural productivity, released large numbers of unskilled workers, and enabled them to work in more productive urban and industrial sectors, with the annual CFP soaring to 3-4%.
The second period of this kind followed Deng Xiaoping's tour of the South in 1992, during which he emphasized the need for a transition to a market-oriented but state-controlled system, opening the country to foreign direct investment and establishing special economic zones to encourage the development of export-oriented industries.
This time, the CFP rose to 5-6%, in part because of the catching-up process that has taken place in China due to the use of knowledge and technology from abroad.
Finally, China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, following deep reforms of state-owned enterprises and the tax system.
With the country fully integrated into global supply chains, CFP growth rose to 4%, where it remained until 2007.
Since then, however, it has fallen back to almost half.
Indeed, growth slowed sharply and permanently after the global economic crisis that began five years ago.
By 2012, human capital's share of China's GDP had fallen almost to zero, while fixed-capital accumulation accounted for about 60% of total growth.
Large-scale debt-financed capital investment has driven the ratio of credit to the country's GDP to nearly 200%, increasing the vulnerability of the system, a trend reflected in the recent rise in interbank interest rates.
To achieve more balanced and sustainable growth, China's leaders must undertake some deep, comprehensive, and long-term institutional reforms to enhance the CFP.
These reforms should, in particular, be used to encourage China to move away from the traditional supply-side growth model, which assumes that the construction of hard infrastructure automatically leads to an increase in demand.
Indeed, economic growth may be slowing precisely because existing investments in manufacturing and infrastructure, made largely by local governments and state-owned enterprises, do not match the pattern of domestic demand.
As a result, China now suffers from short-term excess capacity.
Whether the quality of GDP growth can be improved depends on the willingness of China's leaders to undertake market-oriented reforms.
Instead of directly stimulating investment, governments must emphasize their regulatory and enforcement functions, such as establishing and monitoring standards, building an effective property-rights infrastructure, and managing macroeconomic conditions.
At the same time, the quality and provision of education, health and safety must be improved, as well as corruption and abuse of office reduced.
In short, China must move from meeting growth objectives to providing an environment that fosters innovation and competition, thereby enabling market forces to price and allocate resources more effectively.
This would make the state a mediator and encourage the development of a sustainable economic order in which less is more, a system in which fewer interventions create more opportunities for creativity.
State-owned enterprises undoubtedly played an important role in China's earlier growth model, providing the infrastructure and services deemed necessary for the functioning of global supply chains.
But access to cheap credit from state-controlled banks gives SOEs incentives to generate excess capacity that increases systemic risk to the economy as a whole.
For China's overcapacity problem to be solved, the companies concerned, whether state-owned or private, would have to leave the market.
Only if China's leaders implement comprehensive structural reforms to establish a market-based growth model can the country avoid the middle-income trap that has prevented so many emerging economies from gaining advanced-nation status.
The slowdown in economic growth resulting from such reforms would be more than offset by improved market dynamics and overall economic stability.
The financial party could move on
LONDON - There was a time when league tables only appeared on the sports pages of newspapers.
Now they are a global mania.
There are league tables on schools and universities, on the profitability or social commitment of companies, on the satisfaction of people in different countries and those who try to rank consumer brands by their value.
There is even a ranking of the funniest jokes in the world (I didn't laugh much).
The financial world, too, is full of such rankings.
Investment bankers are waiting with bated breath for the merger and acquisition league tables to emerge, even though the link between high listing and corporate profitability is somewhere between loose and non-existent.
Rankings of banks have been around for quite some time; at the moment, they are based more on capital strength than on investment volume, which is some improvement, but still not very meaningful.
There are also a number of <unk>'s scary league tables which classify financial centres primarily on the basis of business surveys.
In London, and to a lesser extent in New York (some Americans tend to believe that the world will slam the door on them no matter how badly they are received there!), there is a growing question about how badly the financial crisis has affected the reputation and performance of the West's major financial centers.
So far, the latest rankings offer no particular cause for concern to the incumbents.
According to a list compiled by the City Corporation in London, New York and London are still in a neck-and-neck race for first place.
Another list, published by The Banker magazine, sees New York at the top and London close behind, although the gap between them and their pursuers is narrowing.
The values that London and New York receive in terms of the quality and intensity of regulation and the tax burden have fallen.
In both areas, companies seem nervous about the future.
The most striking change in the rankings concerns the rise of Asia's major financial centers, not just Hong Kong and Singapore, but also Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen.
China has given significant support to its financial centres, and results are beginning to emerge.
According to the World Economic Forum's Financial Development Index, Hong Kong and Singapore are actually very close to London, putting China ahead of Italy in terms of financial development.
Rice noodles beat spaghetti!
Some of this may come as no surprise.
As the world's economic center of gravity shifts eastward, the balance of financial activity will inevitably shift eastward as well.
And, assuming that it is prudent to adapt to the inevitable, the appropriate response in London and New York should be to find ways to cooperate with these new centers.
But the more important question for traditional financial centers is whether the international activities that can shift will actually shift.
This is much harder to judge.
There are anecdotes of individual hedge fund managers migrating to Geneva.
Whenever a government or regulator announces any new checks and balances, there are threats from bankers that they will close the shop and go elsewhere with their Porsches and mistresses.
These threats, once politically effective, are now far less effective.
Some politicians and commentators have been quick to respond, with <unk> asking whether it was worth playing host to a global financial market given the cost of clearing up the mess caused by the recent crisis.
This is risky speculation.
No matter how badly the bankers have behaved, and some clearly deserve a decade or more in jail, financial services are a vital part of the London economy.
If the financial sector declines, who will replace it as an employer?
Careless talk about science and manufacturing building ladders out of recession (a favourite image of former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown) is just empty talk.
There are practically no examples of cost-intensive post-industrial societies being able to revive their manufacturing industry once it had crumbled.
London, in particular, has no inalienable right to be a global financial center.
After all, the UK's internal market is considerably smaller than that of the US.
Indeed, financial centers have shifted time and again over the centuries.
Inevitably, if an established location were permanent, Goldman Sachs "headquarters would be in Babylon today.
So there must be a tipping point at which a combination of higher taxes, increased regulatory burdens, and a hostile climate prompts financial firms to relocate.
There is a danger that Britain is approaching that point.
That is why the Financial Services Authority (the UK's financial regulator) and even the Confederation of British Industry (the Confederation of British Employers "Associations), which represents mostly non-financial firms worried about the availability of credit, are increasingly calling for a truce between authorities and financial markets.
The next two or three months will tell us whether peace will be reached and, if so, whether it will last.
As always in peace negotiations, both sides will have to show a willingness to compromise.
Businesses will have to exercise visible restraint in this year's bonus round.
The British Government will not tolerate another party here.
And governments on both sides of the Atlantic will have to decide how far they want to go in punishing banks.
Continued threats of ever higher taxes could prove dangerously counterproductive.
Indeed, if we do not quickly conclude a new social contract between the state and its markets, those markets could go elsewhere.
Murder in Moscow
It is time to dispel the fiction that post-communist Russia was made less lawless by Vladimir Putin's dictatorship of law.
The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one of Russia's bravest and best journalists, a woman who dared to expose the brutal murders of Russian troops in Chechnya, is the latest proof that President Putin has established nothing more than an ordinary dictatorship, with all the usual disregard for the law that goes with it.
This realization is timely for the world, especially for Europe.
The German Foreign Minister is currently working on a strategy for Russian-German relations that would enshrine indifference to Putin's lawlessness as the national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union.
But this indifference turns to appeasement when it encourages Putin to bring his lawless methods to the international stage, as he is now doing in his campaign to economically ruin Georgia.
Politkovskaya's murder unleashed an eerie sense of déjà vu: as when the KGB was at the height of its power, people in Putin's Russia simply disappear.
Politkovskaya's killing is the third politically tinged murder in three weeks.
Enver Siganshin, chief engineer of BP Russia, was shot dead in Irkutsk on 30 September.
Andrei Kozlov, deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia, who was leading a campaign against financial fraud, was killed on 14 September.
The fact that the Russian Prosecutor General, Yuri Chaika, took over the investigation into the Politkovskaya murder, as in the Kozlov case, does not give rise to great hopes, as would be the case in true democracies when representatives of high judiciary circles are involved.
Indeed, the involvement of Russia's highest levels of government is almost a guarantee that the killers will never be caught.
The murder of Mrs Politkovskaya is a particularly grim omen, given that she was one of the Russian President's most powerful critics.
In her articles for one of Moscow's last independent newspapers, Novaya Gazeta, and in her books <unk> In Putin's Russia <unk> and <unk> Chechnya <unk>, Politkovskaya wrote about the dwindling freedom that has become a hallmark of Putin's presidency.
Both the expulsion of former media tsars Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky and the imprisonment of oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky show what Putin's enemies face: exile, detention, or the grave.
I do not accuse Putin's government of killing Politkovskaya through a contract killer.
As an investigative journalist, Politkovskaya has made herself unpopular not only with Putin, but also with many others, not least current Chechen Prime Minister Ramzan Kadyrov, whom she accused of pursuing a policy of kidnapping for ransom.
But even if Vladimir Putin's people had nothing to do with Politkovskaya's murder in the elevator of her apartment building in central Moscow, Putin's disregard for the law created the climate in which the murder occurred.
Like the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in Canterbury Cathedral many centuries ago, this crime was clearly committed in the belief that the king would like it.
Given what Politkovskaya stood for, namely the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies, the government should have ensured that no harm was done to the journalist.
Putin's Russia has already lost 12 leading journalists to murder in the past six years.
None of these crimes has been solved, which would be different if Putin's dictatorship of the law were more than a PR strategy.
The six years since Vladimir Putin appeared in the Kremlin have been a time of profoundly conflicting signals.
On the one hand, the world looks to a young, educated leader who promises to modernize Russia and bring it up to international standards, especially in law enforcement and legal practice.
On the other hand, the president watches in silence as his former counterparts in Russia's FSB (the former KGB) provide no security for those at risk, and launch a series of notorious espionage cases against journalists, scientists, and environmental activists.
These neo-spies include journalist Grigory Pasko, arms control expert Igor Sutyagin, diplomat Valentin Moiseyev, physicist Valentin Danilov and others.
The supposed civilising influence that Russia's role as a partner of the West is supposed to have, such as its chairmanship of the G-8 summit in St Petersburg, seems to have had no effect at all on Putin's Kremlin cabal.
The confrontation with Western values has once again exposed a Potemkin village.
Russia presents a façade of laws and democratic institutions, but behind the scenes, the same blanks rule in an arbitrary fashion.
The danger for this world is that Putin's lawlessness will be exported.
Across the Middle East, a form of criminalized diplomacy is rampant.
Consider Putin's attempt to manipulate Ukraine's presidential election, or the criminal charges routinely brought and withdrawn against opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
Consider conditions in the breakaway regions of Moldova and Georgia, which can only exist because the Kremlin supports them.
Consider how the Kremlin is trying to blackmail its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies.
Every police officer knows that criminals become increasingly brazen when criminal behaviour is ignored.
It is high time the world recognised Vladimir Putin for what he is: a man who will lead Russia back into darkness.
The whole world needs to remember the old Latin maxim qui tacet consentire videtur - those who remain silent seem to agree - and they need to ask themselves whether it is wise to silently condone Putin's formation of a lawless energy superpower.
A Nation in Hostage
The July 6 editorial in Colombia's Diario del Sur newspaper (<unk>) was enthusiastic: "Despite the violence that has plagued us for so many years, Colombia has never seen a day like yesterday: it was historic and memorable in every way."
At noon on July 5, people across the country took to the streets to express their outrage at the murder of 11 regional politicians held hostage by leftist rebels.
A human chain was formed, with participants wearing white shirts.
My colleagues in the capital, Bogota, and in the south of the country, where we run humanitarian projects, report that people were waving white scarves.
White balloons were released everywhere.
News agencies estimate that the march, with more than a million participants, was the largest protest since October 1999, which was also a demonstration against violence and kidnappings.
Although the killing of 11 lawmakers from the Cali region's regional parliament - who were allegedly caught in the crossfire during an attack by an unidentified military group on the leftist rebels - provoked shock and anger, there was no agreement on how to resolve the kidnapping issue.
Some Colombians are calling for a humanitarian deal to exchange prisoners for hostages and reject bloody and violent attempts at liberation.
Others oppose ceding territory (the creation of a demilitarized zone where such exchanges could take place) and demand the government's continued steadfastness and pursuit of the rebels.
As is so often the case in armed conflicts, civilians suffer the most.
The July 5 protest reminded us of the 3,000 kidnappings since the beginning of this 40-year conflict, but Colombians have many other reasons to form human chains and release white balloons.
Consider, for example, Colombia's lamentable first place in the world rankings of countries that have suffered the most injuries from landmines.
According to the 2006 Landmines Monitor, Colombia had 1,110 casualties last year, with Cambodia in second place with 875, followed by Afghanistan with 848.
This largely unnoticed tragedy is symbolic of the conflict in Colombia, which rarely makes it into the media.
If there was such a thing as an overall index of despair, Colombia would probably be number one.
Hostage-taking, killing and mutilation by landmines are just a by-product of Latin America's oldest and longest-running civil war, which has so far displaced three million people - one of the highest in the world and close to the numbers displaced in Sudan, Congo and Iraq.
But even if, miraculously, the fighting came to an end, the wounds of this conflict would not heal quickly.
In addition to helping to find a political solution, the long-term focus must therefore be on reconstruction and reconciliation, so that young people whose lives have been damaged by the civil war can regain perspective and children are removed from the harmful influence of so much violence and bloodshed.
As part of a needs survey, I visited a secondary school in southern Colombia, where the strong presence of illegal armed groups makes social peace an unattainable dream.
After a four-hour ride on a gravel road I reached a village in the highlands.
The smart and friendly teenagers were eager to learn how to surf the Internet, which has just been installed in their school.
But when I asked five of the young people what they wanted to become later, I realised that this conflict had shaped them forever.
Her career aspirations were lawyer, forensic police officer, coroner and soldier.
The fifth wanted to become a chemist to set up a cocaine laboratory.
The teenagers "plans reflect a sad reality: they are the second generation who know nothing more than war.
On the day of the anti-violence demonstration, alongside the editorial in Diario del Sur, there was a small poll asking: "Do you think the security situation [in our regional capital] has improved since the beginning of the year?"
As a result, thousands took to the streets to voice their opinions.
Maybe a start.
A Nation of Vidiots
NEW YORK - The last half-century has been the era of electronic mass media.
Television gave a new form to society in every corner of our world.
Now an explosion of new media devices is complementing the TV: DVDs, computers, game consoles, smartphones, and so on. And there is a growing body of evidence that this media penetration has innumerable negative effects.
It was the United States that led the world into the television age, and America's long love affair with the glass nugget (as Harlan Ellison memorably put it) has the most immediate implications.
In 1950, less than 8% of US households had a TV; in 1960, it was 90%.
Elsewhere, it has taken decades longer to achieve this market penetration, and the poorest countries are still not ready.
Accordingly, Americans became, and probably still are, the largest consumers of television, even if the data is somewhat unreliable and patchy.
Arguably the most reliable figures suggest that Americans watch an average of more than five hours of television a day, a staggering amount when you consider that they also spend several hours a day in front of other video streaming devices.
In other countries, it is several hours less; in Scandinavia, for example, people spend only about half of the US average on television.
The consequences for American society are profound, disturbing, and a warning to the rest of the world, even if it is probably too late to be heeded.
First, heavy TV viewing is hardly enjoyable.
Numerous studies have shown that it is almost an addiction, with short-term enjoyment leading to long-term dissatisfaction and regret: many viewers say they would like to spend less time in front of the TV.
In addition, heavy television consumption contributes to social fragmentation.
Time that used to be spent together is now spent alone in front of the screen.
According to renowned sociologist Robert Putnam, author of leading studies on the erosion of common sense in American society, television consumption is the central explanation for the decline in social capital and the trust that holds communities together.
Americans simply trust each other less than they did a generation ago.
Of course, there are many other factors at play here, but one should not underestimate the atomisation of society caused by television.
Certainly heavy TV viewing is bad for physical and mental health.
Americans are the most obese people in the world, with about two-thirds of the US population now overweight.
Here, too, many factors play a role, including the large proportion of cheap fried food in the diet, but the time people spend sitting in front of the TV is also an important factor.
And no less important than what has happened to the body, what is going on in the head.
Television and related media are the largest suppliers and carriers of economic and political propaganda within society.
America's television stations are almost entirely privately owned, and their owners make much of their money from a constant barrage of advertising.
Effective advertising campaigns that appeal to unconscious urges, usually linked to food, sex and status, create a craving for products and purchases that have little real value for consumers or society.
The same, of course, has happened with politics.
American politicians today are brand names, packaged like breakfast cereals.
Every <unk> idea can be sold with a colourful ribbon and a memorable banner.
All roads to power in the United States lead through television, and access to television always requires a lot of money.
This simple logic has placed American politics in the hands of the rich more than ever before.
Even war can be brought out as a new product.
The Bush administration promoted the premise of the Iraq War and Saddam Hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction in the familiar, colorful, brisk, graphic-based style of television advertising.
The war itself then began with the bombardment of Baghdad, dubbed "Shock & Awe," a live televised spectacle meant to guarantee high ratings for the U.S.-led invasion.
Many neuroscientists believe that the impact of TV viewing on mental health may even exceed that of addiction, consumerism, loss of social trust, and political propaganda.
It is possible that heavy TV viewing leads to a rewiring of the brain and impairs cognitive ability.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recently warned that young children's television viewing endangers their brain development, and called for children under the age of two to be kept away from television and similar media.
A recent survey by Common Sense Media in the US highlights a paradox that is, of course, perfectly understandable.
Children in poor American households now not only watch more TV than children in affluent households, but are also more likely to have a TV in their nursery.
When consumption of a commodity falls as income rises, economists call it an "inferior commodity."
To be sure, mass media can be useful as purveyors of information, education, entertainment, and even political awareness.
But too much media consumption exposes us to dangers that we should avoid.
At the very least, the danger can be minimised.
Successful approaches worldwide include restrictions on television advertising, particularly for young children, non-commercial public service broadcasters such as the BBC, and free (but limited) airtime for political campaigns.
The best defence, of course, is our own self-control.
We can all turn off the TV a few hours more a day and use the time to read, talk and restore the foundations of personal health and social trust.
A Neighbourly Option for Iran
JEREVAN Once again, the issue of whether to bomb or sanction Iran is being debated.
For years, the debate over Iran has oscillated between two bad alternatives.
Some are convinced that an Iran with nuclear weapons would be the worst of all scenarios, worse even than the radioactive fallout from a pre-emptive strike.
But neither a nuclear-armed Iran nor air strikes against it are wise options, certainly not for the region.
The consequences of bombing Iran should be clear: closure of the Strait of Hormuz, soaring oil prices, possible retaliation against Israel (regardless of who launched the attack), and even greater turmoil in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The only certainty of a pre-emptive strike is irreparable and long-term damage to regional security and political and economic stability.
Of course, the alternative is no safer.
A nuclear-armed Iran would transform the security situation of the entire region, and, given the hostility between Israel and Iran, two of these opposing nuclear powers would pose a threat.
To find a way out of this dilemma, we need to understand what Iran wants and how we can meet it without compromising anyone's security.
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said Iran wants to develop uranium enrichment technology for industrial use.
Everyone agrees that Iran has the right to do so.
But the world is divided on whether to believe that Iran will actually do what it says.
If Iran is being disingenuous, as some claim, once it has reached this first stage of uranium enrichment for industrial use, it can easily switch to high-level enrichment for weapons and leave the international community in the lurch: without any communications channel, no observation teams on the ground, and no recording devices to sound the alarm.
That is why the world must no longer focus on the first stage that has already been lost.
Iran has more than 3,000 centrifuges, despite all the international sanctions and threats.
Instead, the world should focus on the second stage, because weapons potential is the imminent danger, and that is precisely what internationally ordered oversight and surveillance mechanisms exist.
The Iranians have always said that they will continue to fulfil their obligations and, as members of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, open their doors to controls.
But the international community must show greater respect for Iran's current industrial goals if it is to cooperate with Iran.
The first step is to alleviate the sense of distress for Iran.
Fortunately, there are voices in America and elsewhere in favor of engaging Iran at the highest level.
But to talk effectively with Iran, one must understand Iranian values and mindsets.
Iranians perceive themselves as a long-established, if not superior, nation, coming from a rich and ancient culture that has survived into modern times.
But they also harbor a historically ingrained sense of insecurity, stemming from frequent conquests and foreign domination, which is now reinforced by the presence of American troops west of them, in Iraq, and east, in Afghanistan.
Their view today is the product of those two worldviews, distrustful of others "motives and proud of themselves as clever, tough negotiators, not without their own resources.
In my meetings with the current and former leaders of Syria and Iran, as well as in my meeting with Saddam Hussein, I heard them all say the same thing: the West wants to get in their way.
Their explanation was that the West was uneasy about the motives and behaviour of ideological states - Syria, Iran and Iraq under Saddam were states with grand aims of Islam, Arab unity or anti-Zionism.
For Iranians, as guardians of faith and national pride, reactions that appear self-righteous and irrational to others are fundamentally necessary and acceptable.
The fall of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction is a historic example of the willingness to sink with heads held high.
Saddam knew that he had no weapons of mass destruction, but he was not prepared to allow inspectors the right to ask questions.
As in North Korea, Iran's neighbors could provide the right mechanism to create a more transparent relationship between Iran and the world.
In the so-called six-party talks, North Korea's neighbors offered tangible incentives to Kim Jong-il's regime to halt its nuclear program, the most important of which was to end North Korea's economic isolation.
Iran, too, feels pressured, though not isolated: it is heavily dependent on trade, not just as an oil seller.
Two-thirds of the population is under 30 years old and unemployment is high; the country needs to attract foreign investment for its oil and gas industry and finance road construction and other infrastructure projects.
Comparisons with neighbouring Turkey are instructive.
Before the Islamic Revolution in Iran, it was ahead of Turkey in terms of foreign direct investment, per capita income, and GDP growth.
Now Turkey has caught up and may even join the European Union.
Other regional comparisons reinforce this trend.
The Qataris have overtaken Iran in the use of the vast natural gas field shared between the two nations.
Tiny Dubai attracts far more foreign investment: Iranians go there for their banking and trade, and to have fun.
Iran's neighbors must convince Iran's rulers that Iranians, too, can participate in the region's growth and even lead the region.
Only an open Iran, fully integrated into the regional economy and given a role commensurate with its size and economic potential, will be able to moderate its siege mentality.
Here, a fundamental step would be for the West to begin to consider Iran as a potential alternative gas supplier by offering to link Iran to the proposed White Stream and Nabucco pipelines, which are currently under development and are intended to bring gas from Central Asia to Europe.
The world's judgment of Iran's motives and actions should not be distorted by Iranian pride.
We can only understand Iran's real intentions by engaging the Iranians and not cornering them.
A new anti-Semitism
We live in a time of violence.
Some believe we are dealing with a new kind of conflict: the "culture wars," such as those between Sunnis and Shiites, or between various tribal groups in Africa and Asia, or even between Islamists and the West.
But the underlying causes of some of these conflicts may well be traditional.
Belonging to a particular cultural group is only a pretext for the struggles between the winners and losers of globalisation.
Unscrupulous leaders mobilize disoriented supporters.
Above all, the losers of globalization, who are often young men with no prospects for the future, can even be persuaded to commit suicide attacks against a supposed enemy.
Perhaps we should not be surprised that in these times the oldest of our ugly, deadly resentments, namely anti-Semitism, is resurfacing.
His recurrence manifests itself in a classical way in the form of personal attacks, such as the recent murder of a young Jew in France or the desecration of symbolic places such as cemeteries and synagogues.
But there is also a more general mood of hostility to everything Jewish.
One might think that anti-Semitism would have died out forever with the Holocaust, but that is not the case.
There are people who deny that the Holocaust took place at all, or at least in its all too well documented form.
This list of deniers ranges from second-rate historians like David Irving to seemingly popular politicians like Iran's recently elected president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
But the evidence of Nazi Germany's actions is so overwhelming that it is possible to confront these deniers without imprisoning them, giving them more attention than they deserve.
But there is another, more dangerous source of anti-Semitism that justifies talking about a new anti-Semitism.
It is related to Israel.
Of course, America is still the first to address anti-Western sentiment, but the second is Israel, the Middle East's only successful modern country, also highly militarized, an occupying power, and ruthless in defending its interests.
It is difficult to accentuate the strange feeling prevailing in the West that could be called Palestinian romanticism.
Intellectuals such as the late Edward Said acted as the mouthpiece of this sentiment, which has also found many supporters in the United States and Europe.
Palestinian romanticism glorifies Palestinians as victims of Israeli rule, points to the treatment of Israeli Palestinians as second-class citizens at best, and highlights numerous instances of oppression in the occupied territories, including the impact of Israel's security fence.
Implicitly or explicitly, people show solidarity with the victims, send them money, even declare suicide bombings legitimate, thereby distancing themselves further and further from supporting and defending Israel.
In theory, of course, it is possible to oppose Israeli policy without being anti-Semitic.
There are enough critics of Israeli policy among Israelis, too.
And yet it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain this distinction.
Jews outside Israel feel they must - rightly or wrongly - defend the country that is, after all, their last hope for security.
Fearful of being sidelined not only in the anti-Israel, but also in the anti-Semitic corner, friends of the Jews also hesitate to speak out.
This defensive attitude on the part of Jews, and the uneasy silence of their friends, means that the stage of public debate is now open to the true anti-Semites, even though they confine themselves to anti-Israeli rhetoric.
Anti-Semitism in all its manifestations is disgusting.
This also applies to other forms of group hatred, but the Holocaust makes anti-Semitism so unique, because it is a feeling that is complicit in the near extinction of an entire people.
But the new anti-Semitism in the rest of the world cannot be fought successfully only through education and arguments.
It is related to Israel.
Anyone who belongs to a generation that regards Israel as one of the great achievements of the twentieth century and admires the way in which this country has become a proud homeland for the persecuted and oppressed is particularly concerned that it is now at risk.
New strategy for North Korea
SEOUL - The long-delayed congress of North Korea's ruling Labor Party has begun and comes at a time of high tensions between North Korea and the international community.
Kim Jong-il's third son, Kim Jong-un, is widely expected to take a key position and be publicly announced as his father's successor.
There are also indications that there will be a reshuffle of key positions within the party that will allow the presumptive heir to form a new power base.
Whatever happens, and whoever emerges as the new leader, North Korea most likely faces an unstable future.
The price of maintaining internal order will continue to rise, as the system's fundamental weaknesses force the new leader to face difficult new challenges.
Moreover, the responsibility for managing this potential instability extends far beyond Pyongyang's leadership.
The fragility of North Korea is indicated by the fact that even such an important political event as the Party of Labor of Korea Congress, held for the first time in three decades, was postponed at short notice in early September.
One reason for the postponement may be a split within the ruling elite, a group that dear leader Kim Jong-il himself can no longer control as successfully as before.
Moreover, Kim's health problems may have worsened much faster than outsiders suspect, complicating matters even further.
"Enough is enough," a middle-level North Korean official said in a recent private conversation with a South Korean visitor to Pyongyang about Kim Jong-un's likely successor.
Ordinary North Koreans, too, seem to view this succession differently from the handover of power to Kim Jong-il from his father, Kim Il-sung.
Moreover, there is no hope that any new leader, whoever it may be, will be given enough leeway to establish absolute control, especially as the economy is in a completely disastrous state, as last year's failed attempt to reform the currency showed.
The regime is under growing pressure from the base of North Korean society and recognizes its own inability to deal with the situation.
For example, for the first time, North Korea's prime minister publicly apologized for a policy error and the failure of currency reform.
The relationship dynamics between the North Korean people and their rulers appear to be fundamentally changing.
One troubling aspect of this shift is that the new leader may feel that he needs to resort more often to brute force to quell popular resistance.
Faced with hardship at home and diplomatic isolation, North Korea's rulers could bolster their self-confidence by possessing nuclear weapons and try to distract the public with brazen and potentially destructive actions abroad.
This year's attack on the South Korean naval ship Cheonan may bode ill.
Indeed, the North Korean threat now stems more from the regime's internal weaknesses than from its aggressive attitude toward the outside world, since the latter is merely the authorities "anxious response to the former.
Unfortunately, however, most international efforts have sought to alleviate the symptoms rather than cure the underlying disease.
In order to put pressure on the North Korean government to abandon its nuclear option, the current international economic sanctions, targeting products for the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction and luxury goods, should probably continue.
At the same time, however, the international community should place greater emphasis on policies aimed at persuading North Korea to implement serious economic reform.
Given the current heightened tensions between North Korea, South Korea, and the United States, implementing such a strategy may seem impossible.
Nevertheless, a roadmap for a peaceful transition can be drawn up.
For example, if North Korea were willing to respect international standards of economic behavior, it could be invited to the International Monetary Fund.
Western governments could also allow charitable foundations to provide scholarships to North Korean officials or students to study abroad and learn how to run a market economy.
Of course, any aid to North Korea would have to be closely monitored to prevent it being misused for military or other political purposes.
The international community would lose nothing if it tried this strategy and tested the regime's will to reform.
Indeed, after the recent currency fiasco, North Korean leaders may have become more open to economic reform than ever before.
Such an approach is also in line with Chinese policy, which has so far consisted of pushing North Korea to adopt the Chinese model of economic reform.
Of course, the North Korean regime is not the only obstacle to international engagement.
Conservatives in the United States and South Korea may argue that North Korea must move toward denuclearization before any economic aid is offered.
But there is no reason why international efforts to ensure North Korea's denuclearization should preclude policies aimed at domestic reform.
We need not assume that these objectives cannot be pursued simultaneously.
On the contrary, it may be impossible to win North Korea's approval for denuclearization without profound internal change.
The past two decades have shown that <unk>'s politically correct decisions do not lead to the right results, even in the long term.
As North Korea seeks a new leader, the world must seek a new strategy for North Korea.
An opportune opportunity to reform the United Nations
The United Nations is torn apart by internal tensions.
No sooner has the controversy over the creation of a Human Rights Council been satisfactorily resolved than a new battle has broken out.
The United States is pushing for administrative reform and threatening to freeze funding if the reforms do not materialize.
The Secretary-General has presented a sensible reform plan, but a majority of UN member states, acting collectively as the so-called G-77, oppose it, seeing it as another step in reducing the General Assembly's authority over the Security Council.
In particular, it objects to the proposal made under the plan to confer additional powers and responsibilities on the Secretary-General, whose election is de facto in the hands of the five permanent members of the Security Council with their right of veto.
Considering that power within the UN has shifted from the General Assembly to the Security Council, many UN members refuse to give up what they see as the last vestiges of their power: budgetary control through the work of the General Assembly's Fifth Committee.
In practice, the Fifth Committee has so far exercised the kind of micro-management of personnel and expenditure that should be in the hands of the Secretary-General, so that the UN can act effectively and have a staff that is up to the challenges facing the organisation.
That is why America insists on administrative reform.
There is an urgent need to find a way out of this impasse.
Failure of the current proposal would effectively mean the end of all efforts to reform the UN, with catastrophic consequences for people around the world who depend on the aid provided by the UN Development Programme, the security provided by the UN's many peacekeeping missions, or the myriad other services provided by UN agencies.
For example, the absence of administrative reform would boost calls in the US Congress to withhold US contributions to the UN budget, a policy that would be hugely damaging to America's own interests, such as the planned expansion of the mission to end the genocide in Darfur.
The path to a satisfactory resolution of the conflict is clear: the General Assembly must play a greater role in electing the Secretary-General, so that members would delegate powers to an authority they have chosen themselves.
This solution would not only allow for the much-needed administrative reforms; it would also bring clarity and transparency to a process that is in urgent need of improvement.
Finally, the UN Charter states: "The Secretary-General shall be appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council."
In practice, however, today the five permanent members agree on the candidate, and their decision is then approved first by the Security Council and then by the General Assembly.
Genuine discussions about a new secretary-general are currently taking place in secret among the five permanent members, adding to the frustration of other U.N. members, including major powers that have sought unsuccessfully to enlarge the Security Council.
In order to bring about the desired reforms in the budgetary procedure, the US must take the lead in persuading the other permanent members of the Council to give the General Assembly a greater role in the procedure.
This could happen in a number of ways.
The Security Council could agree to propose several candidates, from which the General Assembly would then select one.
Alternatively, the General Assembly could propose several candidates to the Security Council, of which the Security Council would then select one and refer it back to the General Assembly for approval.
Either way, the selection process would benefit from greater transparency.
The General Assembly should, for example, hold public hearings in which candidates are interviewed, which would greatly enhance the candidate eventually selected.
Such proposals, if adopted, would help to resolve the current dispute to everyone's satisfaction.
In fact, they could make the UN stronger than ever.
A new opportunity for Darfur
NEW BRUNSWICK, NEW JERSEY - As the crisis in Sudan's Darfur region continues to deepen and negotiations to end it drag on, an international consensus is slowly emerging on a powerful political strategy based on public condemnation, severe economic sanctions and, increasingly, the threat of military force.
But these steps cannot achieve, individually or collectively, the ends that their often well-meaning advocates seek.
On the contrary, they risk reproducing the chaos that such measures have caused in Iraq and elsewhere in recent years.
Remarkably, in the US, even staunch liberal newspapers like the New York Times are missing cautionary voices.
Democratic Party foreign policy advisers, like neoconservatives, are calling for action against Sudan, which is echoed by an international group of intellectuals and celebrities ranging from Umberto Eco, Juergen Habermas and Harold Pinter to Bob Geldof, George Clooney, Mia Farrow, Matt Damon, Mick Jagger and J.K. Rowling.
At the same time, with the support of the European Union, Belgium, Ireland, Austria, Poland, Romania and Sweden are deploying French troops in the Central African Republic and Chad, where they have already clashed with Sudanese government forces, on alleged humanitarian grounds.
The International Crisis Group, Human Rights Watch and many other organizations support the effort, while Save Darfur, which describes itself as an apolitical alliance of more than 180 religious institutions, advocacy groups and philanthropic organizations, has been instrumental in setting the political agenda.
The interventionism of this agenda is gradual: tightening economic sanctions, requiring China to use its influence, establishing a no-fly zone, and using military force against the Sudanese army.
The premise is that only real pressure will finally force the Sudanese Government to welcome the United Nations and African Union peacekeepers, negotiate with the West, disband the dreaded Janjaweed militia, allow refugees from the country's brutal civil war to return to their villages, and make peace with the rebels from the south.
However, achieving these objectives requires the cooperation of the government in Khartoum, and any of the proposed measures would only exacerbate existing tensions or prove useless.
Current Western sanctions, for example, have only pushed the Sudanese regime into the arms of China, Indonesia, and Malaysia.
Indeed, investment in Sudan actually increased by $2.8 billion last year.
Efforts to pressure the Chinese appear similarly futile.
Darfur is hardly a high priority for China, which accounts for 20% of Africa's trade and 60% of Sudan's oil.
Increasing talk in both Europe and America of a boycott of the Olympics (or the opening ceremony) has proved utterly ineffective at influencing China's behavior in Tibet.
Would the threat of a boycott on Darfur really be more successful?
Similarly, even proponents of a no-fly zone have doubts about its potential effectiveness.
After all, Sudan is the size of Western Europe, and Darfur, with its 158 refugee camps, is the size of France.
Strategic restrictions would almost certainly thwart enforcement.
It remains the military option, which would only justify Sudan's fears of Western imperialism.
Worse, given the fragmentation of rebel forces in the south, where an estimated 80 tribes and clans each control their own militias, a military response in Sudan could create a power vacuum and destabilize its nine border countries, many of them weak or failed states.
Western analysts and activists should have learned by now that military threats only lead to resistance, and that true diplomacy involves the use of carrots as well as sticks.
But the emerging political consensus contains no positive incentives for resolving the Darfur crisis.
Nor is it clear whether his goal is to pressure Sudan to change its policies, or to bring about complete regime change.
I have been to Sudan twice and also visited the refugee camps in Nyala and El Fasher in Darfur with a delegation from Conscience International.
I have met dozens of Sudanese politicians and diplomats, and I know that the regime in Khartoum is authoritarian, self-serving and merciless.
But it is not self-contained.
Splinter groups within the regime could support new policies to moderate the climate of violence, reduce the country's dependence on China for trade, improve the situation of refugees, and reduce international tensions.
Such policies could include:
The emerging political consensus on Sudan is based on an approach that has already undermined respect for Western values throughout the non-Western world.
The interventionist policies of the West are not working.
They are unrealistic and ultimately counterproductive.
There is no time to lose: we have to try something new.
A New Beginning for Chinese Journalism?
One notable incident has emboldened Chinese journalists.
This year, the government temporarily suspended publication of the Bing Dian Weekly newspaper, provoking unprecedented public protests that have been widely reported in the world's media.
More surprisingly, the government has allowed Bing Dian to resume publication under public pressure.
The editor-in-chief and the deputy editor-in-chief have been dismissed, but the openly expressed doubts about the legitimacy of governmental regulation of journalism will certainly have strong repercussions.
Foreign observers tend to associate the Bing Dian incident with the recent crackdown on other Chinese mass media, and conclude that there is no hope for press freedom in China under the current autocratic regime.
Undeniably, there have been no significant changes to the government's system of regulating journalism since China introduced its open-door policy nearly 30 years ago.
